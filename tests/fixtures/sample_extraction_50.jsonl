Though weaving was a trade among the Greeks and Romans, every house of distinction, especially in the country, contained a loom, with the requisite apparatus for working wool.  This occupation was supposed to be especially pleasing to Minerva, who was regarded in this character as the guardian of female industry and decorum.  The work was mostly carried on by the female slaves, under the supervision of the mistress of the house, who, with her daughters, occasionally took a part in the more tasteful portion of their labors.  The Greeks and Romans supplied themselves from their own looms with the ordinary articles of clothing;  but the finer textile works of scarfs, shawls, carpets, and tapestry were mostly supplied them from the East.  In the earlier ages of Greece and Rome, it was the duty of the matron, assisted by her daughters, to weave clothing for her husband and sons.
