INTRODUCTORY ESSAY ON THE LANGUAGE OF SOPHOCLES.
</head>

<p>
 The language of the Greek writers of the fifth century в. с. ехhibits a degree of variety, which contrasts equally with the uniformity of Epic poetry and the comparative sameness of Xenophon and the Athenian orators. In no period of any literature do there exist so many linguistic differences between writers who were almost contemporary. These are not simply matters of dialect, and are not adequately described as peculiarities of style. They appear also in a tentative use of words and grammatical constructions which could only have been allowed even to great original writers in a comparatively early stage of literature. They are characteristic of the time when the most copious and plastic of Western tongues was growing into new forms under a manifold creative impulse, given by minds possessed of extraordinary genius and stimulated to intense activity by changes of national and political life. A wider experience than had found utterance in the recitations of the rhapsodists, or in the simpler tones of the earlier lyric and gnomic poetry, and the growth of reflection, giving at once more concentration to thought and also the power of analysing it, required new vehicles of expression. And the first attempt to frame these in the different kinds of Greek literature led to many novelties of language, some of which did not permanently retain their hold. Each writer had his own tendencies, resulting in anomalies peculiar to him and in an undeveloped but active state both of speech and thought, these licences passed unquestioned and easily found acceptance.
</p>

<p>
 The limits of such divergence were not yet determined by grammatical rules. The race that gave grammar to Europe were by this time not unconscious of the complex structure of their language<note n="1">See the Preface to this edition.</note>, but this consciousness was still indefinite, and was rather an incentive than    <pb n="2"/>  a hindrance to invention. It is not easy for us, who often speak as well as write 'like a book,' to imagine what the art of composition must be in such a period of transition, when every considerable writer is a creative artist, and moulds the materials of common speech and early literature to his purpose according to the bent of his individual genius.
</p>

<p>
 The age of Dante or of Luther occurs once only in the life or history of a language. The poetic faculty does, indeed, whenever it appears, exercise a sensible influence in re-creating or modifying the speech through which the poet works, and such a subtle master as Virgil or Goethe, or our own Shelley, will even at a late period produce new combinations, though commonly without violating the established usage, now fixed by a much longer tradition. But the working of the creative force in the adult state of literature gives no adequate conception of the power with which the same spirit operates in a time of transition, when the old materials are partially fused, and re-cast in other forms. At such moments the original instinct of language, which is never quite dormant, bursts forth with new energy, giving rise to phenomena which are intermediate between the first formation of language and a grammatical rule.
</p>

<p>
 It is of some assistance to the English student of this subject to think of the second or Elizabethan stage of English literature, when the comparatively unreflecting art of Chaucer's age was succeeded by another style to which the revival of literature, last felt in England, and the influence of the Reformation had given birth. New thoughts craved new expression, and the stream of utterance was quickened and disturbed by the influx of ideas. Hence arose peculiarities and diversities of language. Great liveliness and subtlety appear together with a certain want of accuracy. Shakespeare often throws words together in a way that would be impossible now, and it may seem no less strange that Spenser and Shakespeare should have been writing at the same time in England, than that Herodotus and Sophocles, or Sophocles and Euripides, should have been contemporary Greeks. In making this comparison, however, it must be borne in mind that logical analogies are more powerful in Greek than in English. simplicity of ancient art extends also to grammar and diction.
</p>

<p>
 The period of expansion and growth in the Greek language began before Simonides, and the last phase of the process (which, however, can nowhere be regarded as complete) appears in the refinements of Plato. The disturbing influence is least visible in the transparent style of Herodotus, who retains in the new form of prose much of the equability and stateliness of Epic narrative. Though contemporary with Sophocles, he in fact represents an intermediate era, that of the somewhat stationary and complacent civilization of the Ionic cities, which was continued after their political independence was impaired. He preserves, even more largely than the Epic poets did, the <term>paratactic</term> structure, or parallelism, which belongs to a very early phase of syntax. This and other archaic traces in him may be partly due to the oral character of his materials and partly to the logographers who preceded him. His work is the conclusion of a period of continuous growth <pb n="3"/>   amongst the Eastern settlements of the Hellenic race; and while the study of him throws much light both on the language and ideas of Attic tragedy, it is a light that falls on them from behind.
</p>

<p>
 But on the western side of the Aegean there had arisen from the beginning of the century, partly under the influence of the colonies acting on the mother states, a series of writers who used language more artificially, chief amongst whom were Pindar in lyric poetry, Aeschylus and Sophocles in tragedy, and Thucydides the historian. Their art was tentative and irregular, often deserting conventionality with great boldness, and yet straitened by the exigencies of a new endeavour. Under many different forms of ingenuity and refinement, or of abruptness and condensation, we recognise in all of them the struggling of the same creative effort. The tragedians worked under conditions peculiar to themselves, and have a certain external community of character. There grew up, as was natural, a sort of common dialect amongst those who were writing the same species of poetry for the same audience. Yet even amongst the tragic writers the variety is at least as remarkable as the resemblance. There are differences in their mode of using grammatical constructions and in their choice of words, besides marked differences of style, which can be traced even in the fragments. There is nothing in tragedy like the uniformity of Epic diction. The Epic commonplace is parallel to the rhetorical monotony of later writers.<note n="1">With the gradual adaptation of language to the drama may be compared the first use of language by the fathers of Greek philosophy, which is also a sort of experiment, and, like the language of tragedy, is intermediate between poetry and prose.</note>
</p>

<p>
 In order to a complete handling of this subject it would be necessary to consider in the first place the general characteristics of the language of Greek tragedy; distinguishing (1) its relation to the Epic dialect and to the language of Herodotus, (2) the infusion of gnomic and (3) of lyric elements which it contains, (4) the traces of vernacular conversational idiom to be inferred from the comparison of Thucydides, the early orators, and the old Comedy, (5) the effects of the effort towards concentration, observable especially in the frequent use of abstract for concrete, of the cognate accusative, of cases without prepositions, and of the poetical plural.<note n="2">Not much light is to be obtained from the remaining fragments of the predecessors of Aeschylus. It is permissible, however, to conjecture that Choerilus had set the example of using rugged metaphor, while Phrynichus had the melodious smoothness which old-fashioned lovers of poetry in the time of Aristophanes attributed to him, but that in other respects the early dramatists departed little from the simplicity of gnomic verse. On the other hand, of the contemporaries of Sophocles, Achaeus of Eretria seems to have delighted in forced and obscure expressions, and Ion of Chios, as we can partly judge even from the few lines of his poetry which remain, indulged like Sophocles, though in a feebler manner, in experiments of diction.</note>
</p>

<p>
 The scope of the following pages is more limited. I have endeavoured to collect into one view some of the chief idioms which occur in Sophocles, including those which have given most trouble to the    <pb n="4"/>   commentators; and I have arranged them under heads, the greater number of which would be found equally applicable to other Greek authors, especially to the Attic authors of the same period. It would be absurd to represent Sophocles as an eccentric writer. But he made subtle use of a material full of subtlety, which was plastic to his touch, and the resulting lines are more difficult to trace than those which have been impressed by some generally accepted mould.
</p>

<p>
 An obstacle to right interpretation is removed when it is once for all acknowledged that canons, however useful, cannot be strictly applicable to language that is still in process of natural growth, and in which primitive naïveté may be looked for side by side with novel abstractions and modes of thought.

PART I.- GRAMMAR.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="intro">

<p>
In attempting to describe the linguistic peculiarities of Sophocles, I propose to consider, first, grammatical constructions; and secondly, the use of words: and shall begin by characterising the structural peculiarities of the Greek language in general, during the transitional period of which I have already spoken.
</p>
 <milestone unit="section" n="1"/>
<p>
In the writers of this period the power of reflecting on language appears rather as a subtle perception of analogies than as a rule of grammar. The mind is feeling after a limit which is not yet clearly prescribed. The genius of logic, inherent in the Greek language from the first, is awakened into fresh activity and has a transforming power over style. The forms of antithesis and inference already begin to complicate expression, and to react on thought, which becomes more self-conscious and less direct and simple.
</p>

<p>
 In this process, which was part of the more general transition from poetry to prose, something was probably due to the change which began some generations earlier, but was still hardly completed, from the habit of oral to that of written composition. The author, who now sat pen in hand with the written page before him, must have become increasingly conscious of analogies of language and modes of thought. This generalized consciousness would be felt and used by him as a new power. Although the ultimate effect of a written literature is to induce a still greater fixity, yet by breaking in upon the conventional sameness of oral composition, the use of writing for a time combined with other causes to bring in a new kind of variety and individuality in the treatment of language. The working of this reflective and logical inventiveness appears chiefly in the opposite forms of analysis and concentration.
</p>

<p>
 The increasing frequency of needlessly minute distinctions, belonging rather to the language than to the thought, the fondness for interrogative and negative expressions, the antithetical structure of whole paragraphs, the perpetual use of the forms of hypothesis, antithesis, and inference, are evidences of the analytical tendency.
</p>

<p>
<pb n="5"/>  The effort of concentration appears in the more complex structure of sentences, and their connection with one another, and in some forms of inference, as well as in the condensation of words and phrases. This concentrating energy seems generally to accompany the poetic instinct in a reflective age, and is a common source of obscurity in the highest literature. For obvious reasons, it has a peculiarly fitting sphere for its operation in the language of tragedy.
</p>

<p>
 A lesser effect of this tendency to reflect on language is the constant attempt to vary and extend the range of idioms, which, ceasing to be used instinctively, are caught up by the fancy of the mind and carried by a sort of metaphor into new applications. The sentences <gloss>are not made, but grow.</gloss> General analogies often prevail over particular uses, and often two currents of logical association meet in one. Hence arise double constructions, changes of construction, and what may be called feeble or imperfect constructions, the government of one word by another being often suggested rather than actually determined. Where language has been fully developed, as in the studied periods of Cicero, the beginning of a sentence is always waiting for the end: the design of the whole is prior to the execution of the parts. But in the stage of language we are considering, the order and coherence of words and clauses are natural rather than grammatical. The meaning breaks upon us as we go along: the antecedent does not <gloss>trammel up the consequence,</gloss> but the apodosis is continually modified by the interference of some intervening word. These are the peculiarities rather than the common characteristicswhich appear with increasing frequency from Homer downwards-the exception, not the rule. It is not of course meant that all the uses of words and constructions in Sophocles or the greater part of them exhibit these qualities, but that there is sufficient to enable us clearly to distinguish between the style of Lucian or Xenophon and that of Sophocles.
</p>

<p>
 The acknowledgment of such an unfixed and growing condition of language may be thought to introduce unnecessarily into the study of Greek syntax an element of uncertainty. And it must be admitted that the attempt to trace constructions beyond grammatical rules is one which may easily degenerate into fanciful subtleties. The study of these varying analogies is more difficult than the ascertainment of a fixed rule, just as curvilinear is more difficult than rectilinear measurement, or as motion is harder to calculate than position. But without attempting in some way to determine the nature of their language, apart from the definitions of a later age, the writers of the transition period can never be thoroughly understood. To require in Sophocles or Thucydides the exact articulation of perfectly grammatical writing would be no less mistaken than to interpret a speech in Coriolanus or Cymbeline as if it were a paragraph of Pope or Johnson. Many conjectural emendations which have been invented to satisfy this unreasonable requirement are found, when rightly weighed, to disturb the real harmony of the composition.
</p>

<p>
 The grammatical consciousness is ever becoming more precise and imposing narrower limits on the use of language. A modern English writer could hardly confuse the singular and plural verb, as was done <pb n="6"/>  continually in the time of Shakespeare<note n="1">It makes no difference that the plural form in s was derived from the Northern English dialect. The confusion existed, and the necessity of clearing it determined the later usage.</note>; nor pass from the second person to the third, nor put 'who' in the objective case, nor omit the nominative, nor interchange the transitive and intransitive verb, nor with the same freedom employ a noun or adverb as a verb, or a verb as a noun,<note n="2">For other instances of Elizabethan freedom, see Mr. Abbott's <title>Shakspearian Grammar</title>.</note> nor speak with Milton of the <gloss>unexpressive nuptial song.</gloss> Even Shelley is hardly permitted, except by his latest editor, to use <quote>loved more</quote> as an equivalent for <quote>felt more love</quote> so as to <quote>include or involve a noun in its cognate verb</quote> (Forman's Shelley, vol. ii. p. 270). Nor could the cultivated Greek of the time of Dionysius, Plutarch, or Longinus, have endured in a contemporary the apparent solecisms which they were quick to observe in Thucydides and other writers of the earlier age. On the other hand, the anomalies of the ante-grammatical writers have an important relation to the abstractions of grammar. They are the symptoms of the first stage of the reflective process which gradually made such experiments impossible, just as the tentative reasonings and even the fallacies of the early philosophers, which could have no existence after the Organon was written, were the necessary antecedents of the Organon.
</p>

<p>
 In Grammar, as in other sciences, the generalizations and distinctions which have been adopted often prove inadequate to the subtlety of the process to be analysed. They are sufficiently applicable to the state of language which they help to perpetuate, though even here they cannot stop the flow of change, but have a less definite relation to the fluctuating analogies of the period in which grammatical structure is a growing framework not yet finally set. The regular grammarian is apt to be baffled or misled in applying his principles to the interpretation of a writer like Thucydides or Sophocles. Yet their so-called irregularities, arising as they do out of the same instinct from which the regular and acknowledged forms of the language have taken their rise, must admit of at least approximate explanation. And there are two ways in which the validity of such a process may be tested: (1) the study of the history of constructions, giving the key to some analogies which the later classification has tended to obscure: (2) if at first sight the method of such interpretation may seem sceptical and fanciful, it is not therefore to be rejected, if supported by a sufficient number of instances either from the same writer or from others. The mere number of such exceptions will prove that they are not merely capricious, but have a rule or principle of their own. It might also tend to prevent vagueness and confusion in such an inquiry, to distinguish between idioms current at the time and idioms of the particular writer. This distinction, however, although real and important, cannot be always accurately observed; partly from our ignorance of the spoken lauguage, and partly because we often cannot tell with certainty how much is due to the genius of a writer, and how much to the habit of his age. In the unfixed state of the Attic dialect, some forms or modes of expression, such as the use  <pb n="7"/>   of the article for the relative, may have been still current in common speech which were afterwards thought to be peculiar to an Epic or Lyric style. And there are probably others which, though passing out of use, were familiar to the hearers of poetry, and from which the 'modern' poet occasionally selected. In the manner of such selection, and in the modification of the selected forms, the characteristic qualities of an author are sure to appear. This is seen chiefly in the general colouring of the language and the choice of words, but is also perceptible in peculiarities of grammatical structure.
</p>

<p>
Sophocles is distinguished in point of syntax from other contemporary writers chiefly by his noble sense of harmony, and by the combination of extreme refinement with moderation and simplicity. He is, to borrow a phrase from Aristotle, ὁμαλῶς ἀνώμαλος : -the first equable writer of the reflective age; for Herodotus, as already noticed, is essentially of an earlier type. The incipient logical analysis, and ethical and political thought, and also the love of condensation, which have such strange effect in the intricate or knotted constructions of Thucydides, are present in Sophocles, and are often in him a cause of uncertainty, but never of harshness. He has neither the ruggedness of Aeschylus, nor the strained ingenuity of Pindar. Like all the greatest writers, he can only be partially studied by the light of his age: he has characteristics of his own, which are best seen by comparing him with other great masters of language in different ages. In the absolute subordination of every tone and emphasis to the dominant feeling, and the perfect adaptation of the language to the degree of tenderness or sternness, of passion or coldness, which is required by the situation, he resembles Virgil and Goethe, and those parts of Shakespeare in which his exuberant invention is most under control. This power of moderation adds greatly to the effect of pathos, in which Sophocles is unsurpassed.
</p>
 <milestone unit="section" n="3"/>
<p>
 The peculiarities of structure in the lyric passages of Sophocles are not essentially different from those in the dialogue. The influence of the earlier lyric poetry is more perceptible in them, just as reminiscences of Homer occur chiefly in the long speeches, and especially in narrative. But both the Epic and Lyric elements, as well as that of common speech, are present everywhere, and are so blended by the poet's art that any broad line of distinction would be illusory. Even the Doric dialect, the traditional vehicle of lyric expression, is only partially assumed, and hardly interferes with the harmony of the general effect. In the following digest of idioms it has been thought sufficient to denote, by the letters <gloss>lyr.</gloss> prefixed, examples taken either from the choral odes or from other lyrical passages. We may therefore here observe the chief particulars in which these differ from the senarii in point of syntax. They are mostly differences of degree. The spirit of fanciful association is more active, and more apt to usurp the place of conventional use. The concentrating effort is more intense, recalling in some passages the spirit of Hebrew poetry. There is more of rapid and abrupt transition, more of substitution <pb n="8"/>  and inversion, of redundance and deficiency. The article is often omitted; prepositions are often added pleonastically. The stress of lyric feeling is combined with the elevation of poetic thought. And the language varies from great simplicity to great complexity, and from the most perfect serenity to the most highly-wrought excitement.

</head>

<p>
   Comparative philology has made familiar the law of decay and regeneration in language, by which inflexions gradually lose their meaning and are replaced by other elements. This process is accompanied by the tendency to analytical expression, which makes the meaning of terminations and prefixes more explicit by the use of auxiliary words. The history of the case-endings affords a striking exemplification of this law. In English, as in most modern languages, there are at most two oblique cases, the possessive and objective, and of the latter the pronouns alone retain the inflexion. The possessive expresses only one relation, and the objective can hardly express more than one without leaning on a preposition. Sanskrit has the accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, and ablative. The Greek language retains traces, in the locative adverbs, of an almost equal number of cases, and each of the three remaining cases expresses a variety of relations, which in the earlier literature were more vividly conceived than in the more conventional usage of later times. It would be instructive to study the gradations of the change from Homer downwards, through the earlier and later Attic, the common dialect and the Byzantine period, to modern Greek. The dying vigour of the old forms would be seen to revive and grow again from time to time. <emph>Experiments</emph> more or less conscious sprang up and withered, before the prevailing habit was finally determined. Opposite tendencies are seen working together: the preposition being sometimes inserted as well as sometimes omitted unexpectedly. In this process, as in every important modification of language, the poetic instinct plays an active part. More conscious than other men of implicit meanings and connections of words, the poet gives new life to the decaying forms. All poetry abounds with novel modes of speech, from which common language selects what is most in accordance with prevailing tendencies and most suitable for use. That the case-endings still retained much of their force in the old Attic is evident from the language of Thucydides. The poet seizes this instrument of condensed expression and strives to multiply it, partly by reverting to earlier modes, but chiefly through analogical and metaphorical applications. The exact intention in each instance is not always easily determined. It was no doubt felt but could not have been explained by a contemporary Greek.
</p>

<p>
 Even in English, where the limits of the experiment are so narrow, there have been similar attempts to extend the use of the cases. Thus the remote object is often expressed without a preposition by a second objective case which thus performs the function of a dative, and there are many instances in the Elizabethan poets of a sort of dativus ethicus. E. g. <quote>A' would manage you his piece thus,</quote> <quote>A good sherris-sack ascends me into the brain,</quote> etc.
</p>
 <milestone unit="section" n="6"/>
<p>
 The question as to the origin of inflexions has little direct bearing on the present subject. Although the theory that derives the cases <pb n="10"/>  from relations of place is most in accordance with the analogy of language-which seems to proceed, like the other phenomena of thought, from without inwards, and is probably true, yet this account of the cases, in the later state of language which is alone known to us, affords hardly any help in determining the multifarious and anomalous relations which in the course of ages have grown up around them. And could it be shown that the function of each case was in the beginning simple and definite, and not rather tentative and vague, yet they have not reached the position in which we first find them without many cross-influences which are hard to investigate. Reflections from other relations, the exigencies of growing expression, and the re-action of different uses upon each other, have woven a sort of tangle, in which the eye can hardly follow any branch to its origin. Hence, while the distinction between external and internal relations may afford a principle of classification, which accords in some degree with changes actually observed, this is not to be supposed equivalent to the distinction between earlier and later modes in the period under discussion. There are further differences which it may be useful to bear in mind. In attempting to analyse the uses which are actually found, it is important to recognize the difference between the metaphysical analogy which has suggested certain constructions, and the rule of usage to which they tend to conform, and, thirdly, the generalization of them which is made by the grammarian. And it may be observed, in passing from this part of the subject, that many things are determined by use, quite regularly, of which no metaphysical explanation can be given, and which can hardly be reduced to a general principle.

THE GENITIVE.
</head>
  <milestone unit="section" n="7"/>
<p>
  The genitive has two main significations, which are clearly distinguished, although in some instances they pass into each other, the ablative and the attributive. The former is gradually discarded, except with prepositions, and the case more and more assumes the character, to which it has been thought to owe the name γενική πτῶσις, denoting the kind to which a thing belongs, and thus tending always to express the wider of two conceptions. The connection between the governing noun, and the noun in the genitive by which it is included or determined, is sometimes so indefinite as to be extremely difficult to analyse. Common uses of the genitive are-

THE DATIVE.
</head>

<p>
   The dative, whether arising out of an original locative case or not, has three main significations, which cannot be further analysed in the existing language.
</p>

<p>
α. Locative, <gloss>In</gloss> or <gloss>At.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
β. Case of the remote object, <gloss>To.</gloss> This may be conveniently called the Dative of Reference.

 <gloss>In</gloss> or <gloss>At.</gloss>
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.1.dative.α.1" n="1">

<p>
The simply locative case, expressing <gloss>in or at a place,</gloss> is no less frequent in the Tragedians than in Homer. Sophocles here as elsewhere condenses language by omitting the preposition, and preserving the independent meaning of the inflexion,

 Sophocles sometimes uses this dative in direct construction with a verb, where a preposition would be interposed by common usage.

 The accusative in apposition to the action, i. e. governed not by the particular verb, but by the general verbal notion, which it is intended further to define, is also common in Greek, especially in poetry. There are two chief cases of this idiom, corresponding severally to a participial clause (ταῦτα ποιῶν) and to an infinitive with ὥστε (ὥστε ταῦτα ποιεῖν).] In Sophocles this use helps concentration, e. g.

  The chief peculiarity to be noticed here is the idiomatic use of φύσιν: e.g.

<p>
By a curious inversion, the predicate, of which φύσιν marks the <pb n="26"/>  limitation, is attracted into the genitive after φύσιν. Such is the most natural explanation of-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 1062.</bibl> <quote>γυνὴ δέ, θήλυς οὖσα, κοὐκ ἀνδρὸς φύσιν:</quote> i. e. the original thought was θήλυς οὖσα φύσιν, καὶ οὐκ ἀνήρ. But φύσιν being postponed, and the construction thus partially obscured, the sentence is continued as if the accusative had followed an active verb (e. g. ἔχουσα). In
<bibl>Aj. 760.</bibl> <quote>ἀνθρώπου φύσιν βλαστών,</quote> the construction appears to be similarly modified from ἄνθρωπος φύσιν βλ., in which φύσιν would be the accusative of limitation. The case of φύσιν here may therefore be explained either as the accusative of limitation or as the cognate accusative.

PREPOSITIONS.
</head>

<p>
   The origin of the Preposition is later and less obscure than that of the cases; and was certainly connected with notions of place. In ἀντί, for instance, the process can still be traced from the locative case of a noun (cp. the French en face) of which the accusative appears in Homer, as in the phrase εἰς ἄντα, first to an adverb of place= ἄντην, and then to the prepositional use, which in the signification <gloss>instead of,</gloss> passes out of the association of place.
</p>

<p>
 As life and thought grew more complex, the variety even of local relations became greater than could be clearly expressed by the case-endings. Hence the preposition became more and more essential as a part of speech: the analytical mode of expression taking the place of the organic, or synthetical, by a process similar to that observable in the introduction of other auxiliary words, as in the σχῆμα Χαλκιδικὸν (ἐστὶν ἔχον, etc.) and the modern Greek substitute for the infinitive mood.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.2.α" n="α">

<p>
 Sophocles still retains the old adverbial use in a few expressions:-
</p>

<p>
 ἐν δέ-<gloss>And there.</gloss>
<bibl>O. C. 55-56.</bibl> <quote>ἐν δ᾽ ὁ πυρφόρος θεὸς | Τιτὰν Προμηθεύς</quote>-<gloss>And there too is the God who brought the fire, Prometheus, Son of Earth.</gloss>
<bibl>Ant. 420.</bibl> <quote>ἐν δ᾽ ἐμεστώθη μέγας | αἰθήρ.</quote>
<bibl>El. 713.</bibl> <quote>ἐν δὲ πᾶς ἐμεστώθη δρόμος-where ev suggests also</quote> <gloss>within.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
This passes from place to time. Cp. ἐνταῦθα=ἐν τούτῳ.
</p>

<p>
ἐπί.
<bibl>Tr. 206.</bibl> <quote>ἐν δὲ κοινὸς ἀρσένων | ἴτω κλαγγά</quote>-<gloss>And at the same time let the men's shout therewith arise.</gloss>
<bibl>O. T. 181 lyr.</bibl> <quote>ἐν δ' ἄλοχοι πολιαί τ' ἐπὶ ματέρες</quote>-<gloss>And wives there, and grey-haired mothers too.</gloss>

<bibl>Ib. 1288.</bibl> <quote>σὺν δ᾽ ἐγὼ παρών</quote>-<gloss>And with him I being present to help.</gloss>

  The prepositional usage is less fixed than at a later time. Partly the conventional mode of expression has not been finally selected, and partly the relation to be expressed is more graphically conceived than in after use. This may be observed also in Herodotus, as compared, for instance, with Xenophon (<bibl>Hdt. iv. 69.</bibl> <quote>κατὰ μὲν ἔκαυσαν Δρύμον πόλιν, κατὰ δὲ Χαράδρην:</quote> <bibl>Hdt. ii. 91.</bibl> <quote>διὰ πάσης ἀγωνίης ἔχων:</quote> <bibl>Hdt. viii. 74.</bibl> <quote>πρὸ . . χώρης μένοντας μάχεσθαι.)</quote> It appears :-

  As the case is used without the preposition quasi-elliptically, so the preposition is sometimes added contrary to use, where such fulness of expression happens to be effective. These opposite deviations arise from the same cause, viz. the comparative liveliness and freedom of the elements of language.

 The use of the plural for the singular is a common feature of the tragic dialect. There is a tendency in poetry to the use of abstract words, which are expressive of feeling, as may be often observed in the substitution of the abstract for the concrete.

<p>
 Of a wholly different kind is the interchange of singular and plural, which arises sometimes from a mere variation in the mode of expression, the indefinite singular being equivalent to the indefinite plural.

ARTICLE AND PRONOUN.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α" n="α">

<p>
 As the Article is sprung from the demonstrative pronoun, and the relative pronoun has the same origin, it is right to consider them together, and the earliest grammarians understood this when they included them under one name as ἄρθρα.
</p>

<p>
 It has been sometimes imagined, in accordance with a tradition of Aristarchus, that the article is always pronominal in Homer, and always, with certain fixed exceptions, merely attributive in later Greek. But the change was gradual, and can partly be traced. There are beginnings of the weaker or simply defining use, even in Homer :-
</p>

<p>
 <bibl>Il. 1.167.</bibl> <quote>σοὶ τὸ γέρας πολὺ μεῖζον</quote>—<gloss>Far greater is that gift which falls to thee.</gloss> <bibl>Il. 23.325.</bibl> <quote>ἀλλ᾽ ἔχει ἀσφαλέως καὶ τὸν προὔχοντα δοκεύει</quote>-<gloss>But holds securely, and watches him the foremost.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
<pb n="32"/>  In these and other such instances, the use is no doubt more vivid than in later Greek; that is to say, an individual image is presented to the mind: but we perceive in them the transition to the usage which afterwards became fixed. On the other hand, there are remains of the pronominal use even in the later Attic (καὶ ὅς, ἢ δ᾽ ὅς, ἡ δ᾽ ἤ, ὁ μέν, ὁ δέ, πρὸ τοῦ, τοῦ ὁ ἔστιν, τῶν ὅσα, τὰ καὶ τά, τὸ δ᾽ ἦν ἄρα, ἐν τοῖς πρῶτος, κ.τ.λ.). <bibl>Plat. Legg. iii. 701 E.</bibl> <quote>οὔτε τοῖς, οὔτε τοῖς.</quote> <bibl>Plat. Legg. iv. 721 B.</bibl> <quote>τῇ καὶ τῇ δὲ ἀτιμίᾳ.</quote>
</p>

<p>
From the early Epic to the late Attic usage, there is a gradation, in which Sophocles comes about half-way. While he employs the article more largely as a pronoun than could have been done at a later time, he is more sparing in the attributive or defining use, which thus retains more graphic power than in ordinary language.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.1" n="1">

<p>
γάρ. The article as a demonstrative is generally accompanied in Sophocles by γάρ or δέ,
<bibl>O. T. 1082.</bibl> <quote>τῆς γὰρ πέφυκα μητρός</quote>-<gloss>For she is my true mother.</gloss>
<bibl>El. 45.</bibl> <quote>ὁ γὰρ | μέγιστος αὐτοῖς τυγχάνει δορυξένων-</quote> <gloss>For he is their greatest ally.</gloss>

<bibl>Tr. 1172.</bibl> <quote>τὸ δ᾽ ἦν ἄρ᾽ οὐδὲν ἄλλο</quote>-<gloss>But, as it seems, this really meant merely.</gloss>
<bibl>Ib. 134 lyr.</bibl> <quote>τῷ δ᾽ ἐπέρχεται</quote>-<gloss>And to him (or to another) comes successively.</gloss>

<bibl>Ant. 1299.</bibl> <quote>τὸν δ᾽ ἔναντα προσβλέπω νεκρόν</quote>-<gloss>And again I see before my eyes this corpse.</gloss> This instance differs slightly from the others, because it has a definite meaning or reference.
<bibl>O. T. 1228-1229.</bibl> <quote>ὅσα | κεύθει, τὰ δ᾽ αὐτίκ᾽ εἰς τὸ φῶς φανεῖ κακά. [</quote>Cp. Pind. Isthm. vi. 61. ἀπ᾿ Ἴσθμου, τὰς δ᾽ ἀπ᾿ Εὐφύλλου Νεμέας.]
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.2" n="2">

<p>
 But the demonstrative use occurs also in a different connexion.
<bibl>O. C. 1699 lyr.</bibl> <quote>ὁπότε γε καὶ τὸν ἐν χεροῖν κατεῖχον</quote>-<gloss>What time I kept him too in my embrace.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.3" n="3">

<p>
 The article as a demonstrative is used adverbially, by a continuance of the Homeric idiom, without the help of a particle.
<bibl>O. T. 510 lyr.</bibl> <quote>τῷ ἀπ᾿ ἐμᾶς φρενός -</quote> <gloss>Therefore,</gloss> etc.
<bibl>Phil. 142 lyr.</bibl> <quote>τό μοι ἔννεπε</quote>-<gloss>Then tell me.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.4" n="4">

<p>
 The relative use of the article in tragic Greek is confined to the cases which have at the commencement (probably to avoid the confusion of ὁ and ὅ, ἡ and ἥ); and occurs in these, as a rule, only where the is required to prevent hiatus. Exceptions are-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 35.</bibl> <quote>σκοπὸς προσήκεις τῶν ἀδηλοῦμεν φράσαι (</quote>where the <pb n="33"/>  reading is questionable) - <gloss>Thou art come as an informant of the things whereof we doubt, to tell us of them.</gloss>

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.5" n="5">

<p>
 The transition to the common use appears in such expressions as-
<bibl>Phil. 371.</bibl> <quote>ὁ δ᾽ εἶπ᾿ Ὀδυσσεύς, πλησίον γὰρ ἂν κύρει</quote>-<gloss>And he said, Odysseus said, for he chanced to be standing near;</gloss> where the noun is in apposition to the article, which still retains its pronominal force.
<bibl>El. 601.</bibl> <quote>ὁ δ᾽ ἄλλος . . . Ὀρέστης</quote>-<gloss>He too.... Orestes.</gloss>
<bibl>O. T. 19.</bibl> <quote>τὸ δ᾽ ἄλλο φύλον</quote>-<gloss>There is another company which,</gloss> etc.
</p>

<p>
Compare the Homeric τὸ δὲ μέγα κεῖται ἄεθλον-<gloss>And there a rich prize is set.</gloss> <bibl>Il. 22.163.</bibl>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6" n="6">

<p>
 To pass now to the attributive or defining use of the article :- The defining article retains a greater liveliness, i. e. more vestiges of the earlier demonstrative use, than in later Greek, and even than in contemporary prose; and the limits of the usage are less fixed. Hence—.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6.a" n="a">

<p>
The article sometimes receives a strong emphasis. Especially remarkable in this connexion is
<bibl>Ant. 409</bibl>, <quote>where the article is placed at the end of an Iambic line- πᾶσαν κόνιν σήραντες ἡ κατεῖχε τὸν | νέκυν</quote>-<gloss>Having wiped off all the dust which covered that corse.</gloss> Cp.
<bibl>Ib. 404.</bibl> <quote>ὃν σὺ τὸν νεκρόν</quote>—<gloss>That corpse that thou,</gloss> etc.

<bibl>Ib. 1050.</bibl> <quote>ὁ καιρὸς εὑρῆσθαι τάδε</quote>-<gloss>It is full time that this discovery be made.</gloss>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.α.6.b" n="b">

<p>
 The article is omitted-
</p>

<p>
 (1) With one of two co-ordinate words, though added to the other.

 Sophocles, like other writers, uses the article to express a general notion, e. g.
</p>

<bibl>Tr. 144.</bibl> <quote>τὸ . . νέαζον</quote>-<gloss>The young creature.</gloss>
<bibl>Ib. 374.</bibl> <quote>τὸ .. ὀρθόν</quote>-<gloss>What is right.</gloss>

 The forms του, τῳ, τοῦ, τῷ, and in
<bibl>Tr. 984 lyr.</bibl> the dat. pl. τοῖσι; for τινός, τινί, τίνος, τίνι, τίσι, have been treated by Ellendt and others as inflections of ὁ, ἡ, τό, but are now known to be anomalous cases (heteroclita) of τίς, as from a nom. τέος. In proof of this, it may be observed that Ionic Greek has τοῦ and τέῳ, τευ and τεῳ, in the interrogative and indefinite meaning, but never as cases of the article.

</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.4.β.1" n="1">

<p>
 The demonstratives, especially ὅδε, are often so used that the antecedent or correlative has to be gathered from the context.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>El. 963.</bibl> <quote>καὶ τῶνδε μέντοι,</quote> where the antecedent to τῶνδε has to be inferred from the adverbs ἄλεκτρα . . ἀνυμέναιά τε.
</p>

<p>
 Thus ὅδε frequently refers not to something present but to something which has just been mentioned or suggested.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 17.</bibl> <quote>πρὶν τῆσδε κοίτης ἐμπελασθῆναι</quote>-i. e. the marriage with Achelous.
<bibl>Ib. 716-18.</bibl> <quote>τοῦδε ὅδε .. τόνδε</quote>-Nessus Hercules, neither of whom is present.
<bibl>Phil. 132.</bibl> <quote>σοὶ παρεὶς τάδε.</quote>
<bibl>Ib. 305</bibl>,
<bibl>O. T. 242</bibl>, 801, 948, 1157, Tг. 933, 935.
</p>

<p>
 So the adverb τῇδε
<bibl>O. C. 641.</bibl> <quote>τῇδε γὰρ ξυνοίσομαι.</quote>
<bibl>El. 1302.</bibl> <quote>καὶ τοὐμὸν ἔσται τῇδ᾽.</quote>
</p>

<p>
 On the other hand, ὅδε is used with pointed emphasis not only for the first personal pronoun (
<bibl>O. C. 450</bibl>, etc.), but as an indirect expression for the possessive pronoun of different persons. (Cp. These hands shall tear her, Shak. Much Ado, iv. 1).
<bibl>Ant. 449.</bibl> <quote>τούσδ' ὑπερβαίνειν νόμους-</quote> <gloss>To transgress our edict.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
 And with a certain pathos in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Phil. 822.</bibl> <quote>κάρα γὰρ ὑπτιάζεται τόδε</quote>-<gloss>For, see, his head falls backwards.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
 Also ὅδε sometimes=ὧδε.
<bibl>Tr. 883 lyr.</bibl> <quote>τάνδ' αἰχμὰν βέλεος κακοῦ ξυνεῖλε-</quote> <gloss>Thus seized?</gloss> or=τῇδε,
<bibl>Phil. 163.</bibl> <quote>στίβον ὀγμεύει τόνδε.</quote> <pb n="35"/>  οὗτος occurs similarly without a distinct correlative.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Ant. 990.</bibl> <quote>αὕτη κέλευθος,</quote> referring to κοινὴν ὁδὸν | δύ᾽ ἐξ ἑνὸς βλέποντε.
<bibl>Phil. 288.</bibl> <quote>τὰς ὑποπτέρους | βάλλον πελείας, πρὸς δὲ τοῦθ᾽ ὅ μοι βάλοι</quote>-<gloss>Wounding the feathered doves, and up to this, whatever my shaft might wound.</gloss>

<bibl>Phil. 436.</bibl> <quote>λόγῳ δέ σ᾽ ἐν βραχεῖ τοῦτ᾽ ἐκδιδάξω.</quote>
</p>

<p>
In
<bibl>O. T. 1180.</bibl> <quote>οὗτος . . ὅν φησιν οὗτος -</quote> <gloss>If you are he, he says you are,</gloss> the first οὗτος is thus used, while the second is employed in the usual way. Cp. Shak. H. VIII. i. 1. <gloss>Must fetch him in he papers,</gloss> where there is a similar ambiguity in the two pronouns.
</p>

<p>
So τοιοῦτος.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Phil. 1049.</bibl> <quote>οὐ γὰρ τοιούτων δεῖ, τοιοῦτός εἰμ᾿ ἐγώ –</quote> <gloss>Where such are needed, such am I.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
And κεῖνο,
<bibl>Phil. 850-851 lyr.</bibl> <quote>κεῖνο .... ὅπως πράξεις.</quote>
</p>

<p>
 The familiar distinction between ὅδε and οὗτος is not always preserved. They are sometimes used alternately with the same reference, for variety and to suit the verse.
<bibl>Ant. 189</bibl>, 296, 297, 673,
<bibl>O. T. 947-948</bibl>,

THE ADJECTIVE

 <milestone unit="section" n="23"/>
<p>
  With respect to the Adjective, as well as to the case-endings, the feeling of analogy was stronger in the age of Sophocles, and the force of convention weaker, than at a later time; and he is able to extend adjectival uses, from the same instinctive consciousness of the meaning of inflexions to which the extension of the case-idioms is also due. And speaking generally, the adjective is used by him (as by earlier writers) with greater freedom than in ordinary Attic Greek.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.5.α" n="α">

<p>
One obvious peculiarity which he shares with the other Tragic poets is the tendency to redouble epithets, often without any connecting particle; e. g.
</p>

<p>

<p>
 The rule that the article or other determinative word should immediately precede an adjective when used attributively is apparently broken, by an epithet being introduced after a noun to which (1) the article or (2) an interjection has been attached. The adjective in this case may be regarded as placed in apposition to the noun, and as conveying an implied predication. It will be observed that in several instances there is a possessive pronoun preceding the noun.

THE ADVERB.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α" n="α">

<p>
The Adverb, like the preposition, to which it is allied (see above, p. 26, § 18), is sometimes made to bear an unusual emphasis or stress of meaning; e. g.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 608.</bibl> <quote>γνώμῃ δ᾽ ἀδήλῳ μή με χωρὶς αἰτιῶ</quote>-<gloss>But do not on a vague surmise accuse me apart,</gloss> i. e. without the proofs indicated above.
<bibl>Ib. 1282.</bibl> <quote>ὁ πρὶν παλαιὸς δ᾽ ὄλβος ἦν πάροιθε μὲν | ὄλβος δικαίως–</quote> <gloss>Their ancient happiness in that former time was happiness indeed.</gloss>
<bibl>Ant. 70.</bibl> <quote>ἐμοῦ γ᾽ ἂν ἡδέως δρῴης μέτα -</quote> <gloss>Would there be any pleasure in your doing it with me.</gloss>
<bibl>Phil. 758.</bibl> <quote>ἴσως | ὡς ἐξεπλήσθη</quote>-<gloss>In equal virulence as it sated itself before.</gloss>
<bibl>Ant. 1069.</bibl> <quote>ψυχήν τ᾿ ἀτίμως ἐν τάφῳ κατώκισας</quote>-<gloss>And hast dishonoured by entombment a living soul.</gloss>
<bibl>O. C. 428.</bibl> <quote>οὕτως ἀτίμως πατρίδος ἐξωθούμενον-</quote> <gloss>So dishonoured with banishment.</gloss>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α.1" n="1">

<p>
 By this means the adverb is brought into relation with the whole clause rather than with any particular word.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 675.</bibl> <quote>αὑταῖς δικαίως εἰσὶν ἄλγισται φέρειν</quote> <gloss>With justice are hardest to themselves to bear.</gloss>
<bibl>Aj. 183-5 lyr.</bibl> <quote>οὔποτε γὰρ φρενόθεν γ᾽ ἐπ᾿ ἀριστερά, |... ἔβας | τόσσον</quote> <gloss>For surely not of thy sane mind didst thou go so far astray.</gloss>

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.6.α.2" n="2">

<p>
 Hence also the adverb is found expressing the predicate, not only in the common instances of words of place like πέλας, but in others also. (Cp. Shak. Cymb. i. 1. <gloss>You speak him far.</gloss>)

Uses of μή.
</head>

<p>
  μή, originally the prohibitive particle, is adapted in Greek, through various uses, to express purpose, hypothesis, general or abstract notions, and also negations that are viewed not merely as facts, but as determinations of volition, feeling, or thought. Extensions of the use of μή in Sophocles arise partly from his love of refining on language; and partly from the tendency to more abstract modes of expression. A few points are deserving of special notice.

</p>

<p>
The tendency to make an implied negative explicit is a common feature of Greek syntax. Negative expressions are apt to be unduly emphasized in consequence of some latent consciousness that their significance is imperfectly realized.

<p>
 Another form of this phenomenon is the use of μὴ οὐ with infinitives and participles.

  The pleonastic oὐ in this and similar idioms (οὐ μᾶλλον ἢ οὐ, <bibl>Hdt. iv. 118</bibl>, <bibl>Hdt. v. 94</bibl>, <bibl>Hdt. vii. 16</bibl> § 3, <bibl>Thuc. ii. 62</bibl>: πρὶν δ᾽ οὐδὲν ὀρθῶς εἰδέναι, τί κ.τ.λ.
<bibl>Eur. Hel. 322</bibl>) is caused by the difficulty of holding two negatives at once (or a negative with an interrogative or comparative) distinctly before the mind.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.7.η.3.a" n="a">

<p>
 Where a negative or privative notion has been negatived, and is further explained, μὴ οὐ is used with an epexegetic infinitive or participle; especially when the chief negation refers to circumstances actually present. [<bibl>Plat. Rep. i. 354 B.</bibl> <quote>οὐκ ἀπεσχόμην τὸ μὴ οὐκ ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἐλθεῖν.]</quote>
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 90.</bibl> <quote>νῦν δ᾽, ὡς ξυνίημ᾽, οὐδὲν ἐλλείψω τὸ μὴ οὐ | πᾶσαν πυθέσθαι τῶνδ᾽ ἀλήθειαν πέρι.</quote>

</p>

<p>
  An interrogative takes the place of the chief negative :-
<bibl>Aj. 540.</bibl> <quote>τί δῆτα μέλλει μὴ οὐ παρουσίαν ἔχειν;</quote>
</p>

<p>
  In the above instances the circumstances of the negation are actual and present: but in others, where the case is hypothetical, or actual but remote in time, μή alone is used.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 1387.</bibl> <quote>οὐκ ἂν ἐσχόμην | τὸ μὴ ᾿ποκλῇσαι τοὐμὸν ἄθλιον δέμας.</quote>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.7.η.3.b" n="b">

<p>
In adding a negative ground or condition to a negative statement μὴ οὐ is used with the participle.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.7.η.3.c" n="c">

<p>
A special case of the last mentioned idiom (μὴ οὐ giving a negative condition of a negative statement) occurs, where a supposed course of action is deprecated, or marked as blameworthy. In this connexion the infinitive is more frequent, but the participle is also used. [Plato, Prot. 352 D. αἰσχρόν ἐστι καὶ ἐμοὶ ... μὴ οὐχὶ ... φάναι. Ι.e. αἰσχρὸν ἂν εἴη, εἰ μὴ φαίην.]

</p>

<p>
This might have been expressed according to the Platonic idiom: δυσαλγήτου ἀνδρός ἐστι τὸ μὴ οὐ κατοικτείρειν τοιάνδε ἔδραν.
</p>

<p>
  Here, as in the examples under a, the circumstances of the negation (δυσάλγητος=οὐκ εὐτρεπὴς πρὸς τὸ ἀλγῆσαι) are present and actual (τοιάνδε ἔδραν); but in
<bibl>O. T. 76-77.</bibl> <quote>ὅταν δ᾽ ἵκηται, τηνικαῦτ᾽ ἐγὼ κακὸς | μὴ δρῶν ἂν εἴην πάνθ' ὅσ᾽ ἂν δηλοῖ θεός,</quote> they are prospective and contingent, and οὐκ is excluded; as also in
<bibl>O. T. 1457.</bibl> <quote>μὴ ἐπί τῳ δεινῷ κακῷ (σωθείς),</quote> where they are remote in time.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 13.</bibl> Suppose that to
<bibl>Aj. 1330.</bibl> <quote>ἢ γὰρ εἴην οὐκ ἂν εὖ φρονῶν</quote> a negative clause expressive of the ground or condition of this statement had been added, μὴ οὐ would have been in place. Ε. g. εἴπ᾿· ἢ γὰρ εἴην οὐκ ἂν εὐ φρονῶν, φίλῳ | σοφῷ θ' ὁμοίως ἀνδρὶ μὴ οὐχὶ συμφέρων.]

<p>
 With respect to interrogative particles it is enough to mention that the long apa is sometimes equivalent to ἆρ' οὐ, or rather expresses a stronger certainty. This may be explained by supposing an ironical or indignant suppression of the negative, as unnecessary in so clear a case. Cp. the English, <gloss>Is it so, or is it not?</gloss> which implies a more vehement asseveration than <gloss>Is it not so?</gloss>

VOICES. The tendency to subtle and indirect forms of expression leads to several exceptional uses of the active, middle, and passive voices.

<head>
ACTIVE VOICE.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.1.a" n="a">

<p>
 There is a peculiar use of the active participle neuter, which occurs in Sophocles and some contemporary writers, though not at all in earlier, and rarely in later Greek.
</p>

<p>
  A state of the person, generally mental, is expressed by the neuter participle with the article, which thus becomes a sort of subject; e.g. <bibl>Thuc. i. 36.</bibl> <quote>τὸ μὲν δεδιὸς αὐτοῦ :</quote> <bibl>Thuc. iii. 9.</bibl> <quote>ἐν γὰρ τῷ διαλλάσσοντι τῆς γνώμης καὶ αἱ διαφοραὶ τῶν ἔργων καθίστανται :</quote> <bibl>Thuc. v. 9.</bibl> <quote>τοῦ μένοντος (</quote><gloss>the determination to stand firm</gloss>) : <bibl>Thuc. vi. 24.</bibl> <quote>τὸ μὲν ἐπιθυμοῦν τοῦ πλοῦ :</quote> <bibl>Thuc. vii. 68.</bibl> <quote>ἀποπλῆσαι τῆς γνώμης τὸ θυμούμενον.</quote>
</p>

<p>
  This idiom arises partly from the difficulty of finding expressions for mental phenomena, and partly from the tendency to express feelings as states of emotion, and hence to employ the verb rather than the noun. The only continuance of this use in later Greek is in such philosophical terms as τὸ αἰσθανόμενον, τὸ ὀρεγόμενον, τὸ νοοῦν, τὸ ἡγούμενον, τὸ προαιρούμενον, τὸ συνειδός.
</p>

<p>
  The Sophoclean examples are-

 The absolute or otherwise intransitive use of active verbs will be considered as a point of diction (in Part II). But the following rare actives deserve notice here :-ἄζονθ' (
<bibl>O. C. 134</bibl>), μηχανᾶν (
<bibl>Aj. 1037</bibl>), ὁρίζει (

<bibl>Ib. 255</bibl>), εἴρυσον (
<bibl>Ib. 1033</bibl>). See notes in ll. In each of these cases the active voice, marking the absoluteness of the action, is more dignified than the middle would have been. <pb n="52"/>

 In all Greek, especially in poetry, there is a tendency to express actively states and conditions which are really passive, as in the familiar φύειν τρίχας, etc. Hence αἴρειν and other active verbs are used of passive states.

<p>

</p>

<p>
  The middle forms of ὁράω and εἶδον are retained by Sophocles, partly in continuation of Epic usage, but also with a degree of <term>ethical</term> or <term>pathetic</term> meaning.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 244 lyr.</bibl> <quote>οὐκ ἀλαοῖς προσορωμένα ὄμμα σὸν ὄμμασιν</quote>-<gloss>Looking in thine eyes with eyes of mine that are not blind.</gloss> Cp. infr. d.

</p>

<p>
  In the following examples the reflexive meaning of the voice is more distinct-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Ant. 713.</bibl> <quote>κλῶνας ὡς ἐκσώζεται</quote> -<gloss>How they save their twigs.</gloss>
<bibl>Aj. 43.</bibl> <quote>χεῖρα χραίνεσθαι φόνῳ -</quote> <gloss>That he imbrues his hand in blood.</gloss>

<bibl>Phil. 613.</bibl> <quote>ἄγοιντο.</quote>
<bibl>Ib. 1325.</bibl> <quote>γράφου φρενῶν ἔσω.</quote>
</p>

<p>
  The effect is slightly different in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Aj. 647.</bibl> <quote>φύει τ᾽ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται</quote>-<gloss>Brings forth from the unknown, and when they are come forth, hides them in her own breast;</gloss> where κρύπτεται = κρύπτει εἰς ἑαυτήν, <gloss>hides in her bosom.</gloss> In
<bibl>Ant. 1093.</bibl> <quote>ἀμφιβάλλομαι τρίχα</quote>-<gloss>I am crowned with these locks,</gloss> the verb is passive rather than middle.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.2.c" n="c">

<p>
 The Middle is used causatively in the following instances :-
</p>

<bibl>Ib. 951.</bibl> <quote>τί μ᾽ ἐξεπέμψω</quote>-<gloss>Why hast thou had me brought?</gloss>

  The causative use, however, is by no means peculiar to the middle voice, and belongs to it only per accidens. See note on

The Subjective Middle.
</head>

<p>
  This use of the middle voice is of much wider extent in Greek from Homer to Plato than has been commonly supposed. It may be familiarly explained as equivalent to the active voice with the genitive of the reflexive pronoun. I. e. if the directly reflexive middle=ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτόν, and the indirectly reflexive = ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτῷ, then the subjective middle voice=ποιεῖν τι ἑαυτοῦ, ἐκ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ, οἱ ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ. Common examples are ἀποδείκνυσθαι, <gloss>To display one's own attributes,</gloss> παρέχεσθαι, <gloss>To provide from one's store,</gloss> ἀποφαίνεσθαι, <gloss>To declare from oneself.</gloss> Cp. <bibl>Hdt. iv. 172.</bibl> <quote>διδοῖ δῶρον τὸ ἂν ἔχῃ φερόμενος ἐξ οἴκου.</quote>

PASSIVE VOICE.
</head>

<p>
   Sophocles shows a singular fondness for the Passive Voice.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.3.a" n="a">

<p>
As the active gives additional liveliness, the passive is convenient where there is reason to prefer an impersonal mode of expression.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 632.</bibl> <quote>πρὶν εἰδέναι τἀκεῖθεν εἰ ποθούμεθα -</quote> <gloss>Before knowing matters in that quarter, whether we are an object of affection there.</gloss>

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.3.b" n="b">

<p>
The passive has also the effect of giving a stronger emphasis to the verb :-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 997-998.</bibl> <quote>ἡ Κόρινθος ἐξ ἐμοῦ πάλαι | μακρὰν ἀπῳκεῖτ'</quote> -<gloss>Long since Corinth was removed far off from being my dwelling-place.</gloss>

</p>

<p>
  Or to the object of the action, by making this the subject of the passive form. [<bibl>Hdt. iv. 105.</bibl> <quote>λέγονται . . . ὑπὸ Σκυθέων . . ὡς ... ἕκαστος λύκος γίγνεται.]</quote>
</p>

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.α.3.c" n="c">

<p>
As the action is projected so as to form the cognate accusative (or <term>internal object</term>) of an active verb: so the subject of the passive voice is sometimes <term>of cognate signification</term> to the verb.

TENSES.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.1" n="1">

<p>
The present (or imperf.) and aorist are sometimes combined to mark the relation of a momentary to a continuous action.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 1457.</bibl> <quote>θνήσκων ἐσώθην</quote>-<gloss>I was saved when at the point of death.</gloss>
<bibl>Phil. 670.</bibl> <quote>εὐεργετῶν γὰρ καὐτὸς αὔτ᾽ ἐκτησάμην</quote> -<gloss>It was in doing a kindness that I gained them.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.2" n="2">

<p>
 There is a tense in English which has no distinct equivalent in Greek, viz. <gloss>I have been doing</gloss> so and so. This is expressed commonly by the imperfect, or by the present, where the action still continues.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 600.</bibl> <quote>πράσσω . . ἕως σὺ ἠγορῶ</quote>-<gloss>I am doing this, and have been doing it, while you have been talking.</gloss> By a similar use the present (or imperfect) participle denotes past time.

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.3" n="3">

<p>
The continuous tenses are used to express endeavour. A strong instance of this <term>conative</term> use is in-
<bibl>O. C. 992.</bibl> <quote>εἴ τίς σε τὸν δίκαιον αὐτίκ᾽ ἐνθάδε | κτείνοι παραστάς-</quote> <gloss>If here and now one were to come near and attempt your life, just man as you are.</gloss> So

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.4" n="4">

<p>
 The present participle partly loses the association of time, and tends to be used simply as a noun of the agent.

<p>
 The aorist often denotes the beginning of a state: e. g. ἔσχον =<gloss>I came to have,</gloss>

</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="A.8.β.6" n="6">

<p>
The use of the aorist in tragic Greek to point emphatically to something in the immediate past, where the present would be used in most languages, is well known. The momentariness of the tense favours this mode of speaking.
</p>

<p>
An extension of this use occurs where something present is made the subject of inquiry or reflection. Here the principle seems to be that what is thought of must have a previous existence; the object must exist before it can be thought. (Compare the use of ἦν in such philosophical expressions as τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι.)

<bibl>Ant. 1307.</bibl> <quote>ἀνέπταν φόβῳ</quote>-<gloss>I am startled with dread.</gloss>

  This aorist has a pathetic force in-

ΕΡΕΧEGESIS
</head>

<p>
 Epexegesis is frequent in classical Greek, arising partly from a fusile condition of language, in which the thought still moves, while it is being expressed, and also from a tendency to redundance, by which symmetry is often sacrificed to fulness and clearness. The act of expression tends to suggest some new aspect or point of view, which makes a sort of excrescence on the original construction, in the shape of an explanatory clause.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.2.a" n="a">

<p>
 The most common form is the epexegetic infinitive. [<bibl>Hdt. i. 176.</bibl> <quote>ὑπῆψαν τὴν ἀκρόπολιν πᾶσαν ταύτην καίεσθαι.]</quote>

ATTRACTION
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="35"/>
<p>
  Attraction is the grammatical name for a very general tendency in Greek to draw words into apparent construction with the nearest word. In constructions πρὸς τὸ σημαινόμενον the meaning takes the place of grammatical analogy; in Attraction the meaning and the grammatical analogy both give way to mere contiguity. A new analogy is thus created, and is sanctioned by use.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.a" n="a">

<p>
 The simplest mode of attraction is where the relative assumes the case of the antecedent.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>El. 177 lyr.</bibl> <quote>μήθ' οἷς ἐχθαίρεις | ὑπεράχθεο.</quote>
</p>

<p>
This happens even where the case of the relative without the attraction would be other than the accusative, as in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Ant. 546.</bibl> <quote>ἃ μὴ ᾿θιγες ποιοῦ σεαυτῆς; ⅰ. Ε. ταῦτα, ὧν μὴ ᾿θίγες.</quote>
</p>

<p>
So with the relative adverb.
<bibl>Tr. 701.</bibl> <quote>ἐκ δὲ γῆς, ὅθεν | προὔκειτ' (= οὗ προὔκειτο).</quote>
</p>

<p>
  Where the antecedent is omitted, the preposition is sometimes added to the case.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 334.</bibl> <quote>ξὺν ᾧπερ εἶχον=ξὺν τούτῳ, ὅνπερ εἶχον.</quote>
<bibl>Ib. 625.</bibl> <quote>ἐν οἶσιν ἠρξάμην= ἐν τούτοις, οἷς ἠρξάμην.</quote>
</p>

<p>
The converse is also frequent, where the antecedent is assimilated to the relative, or taken into the dependent clause.
<bibl>Tr. 283.</bibl> <quote>τάσδε δ᾽ ἅσπερ εἰσορᾷς.</quote>
<bibl>O. C. 1150.</bibl> <quote>λόγος δ' ὃς ἐμπέπτωκεν ἀρτίως ἐμοὶ .. συμβαλοῦ γνώμην</quote>—<gloss>But give us your thought on a matter that has just fallen in my way.</gloss>
<bibl>Tr. 225.</bibl> <quote>οὐδέ μ' ὄμματος | *φρουρὰν παρῆλθε, τόνδε μὴ λεύσσειν στόλον</quote>-<gloss>Nor hath it passed my eye's strict watch, that I should fail to see this band.</gloss> Sc. ὅδε ὁ στόλος παρῆλθεν, (ὥστε) μὴ λεύσσειν αὐτόν. <pb n="60"/>
</p>

<p>
 A marked example of this inverse attraction occurs in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 1227 lyr.</bibl> <quote>βῆναι κεῖθεν ὅθεν περ ἥκει,</quote> i. e. κεῖσε, ὅθεν.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.b" n="b">

<p>
 The subject of an infinitive is often drawn into agreement with a preceding dative.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 92.</bibl> <quote>καὶ γὰρ ὑστέρῳ τό γ' εὖ | πράσσειν.</quote>
</p>

<p>
An extension of this analogy to the genitive probably accounts for the construction of the participle in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Phil. 1140-2.</bibl> <quote>ἀνδρός τοι τὸ μὲν εὖ δίκαιον εἰπεῖν· | εἰπόντος δὲ μὴ φθονερὰν | ἐξῶσαι γλώσσας ὀδύναν</quote>-<gloss>To give full utterance to (τὸ εὐ εἰπεῖν) a just sentiment (δίκαιον) becomes a man, but not in uttering it to thrust forth venom from an envious tongue.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="B.4.c" n="c">

<p>
 Attraction sometimes occurs in hypothetical and other coordinate clauses besides the relative.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Aj. 488.</bibl> <quote>εἴπερ τινὸς σθένοντος-</quote> <gloss>Strong if any were so.</gloss>
<bibl>O. C. 734.</bibl> <quote>σθένουσαν . . εἴ τιν' Ἑλλάδος.</quote>
<bibl>El. 317.</bibl> <quote>τοῦ κασιγνήτου τί φής; ἥξοντος, ἢ μέλλοντος;</quote> i. e. ἥξοντα ἢ μέλλοντα.
<bibl>Aj. 1415.</bibl> <quote>τῷ πάντ' ἀγαθῷ, | κοὐδενί πω λῴονι θνατῶν</quote> <gloss>To him who was good every way, no one of mortals better.</gloss>
<bibl>O. C. 870.</bibl> <quote>(σὲ δοίη βίον) τοιοῦτον οἷον κἀμὲ γηράναι (ἐγὼ</quote> is assimilated to σέ.)
<bibl>Tr. 683.</bibl> <quote>χαλκῆς ὅπως δύσνιπτον ἐκ δέλτου γραφήν</quote>—<gloss>Like writing on a brazen tablet, hard to erase:</gloss> (χαλκῇ ἐν δέλτῳ γραφήν was the first thought, but has been drawn into construction with δύσνιπτον.)
</p>

<p>
It is part of the same tendency when, as often happens in similes, the thing compared is expressed in terms suggested by the comparison; e. g.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 31-3.</bibl> <quote>οὓς κεῖνός ποτε, | γήτης ὅπως ἄρουραν ἔκτοπον λαβών, | σπείρων μόνον προσεῖδε κάξαμῶν ἅπαξ.</quote>
<bibl>Ib. 537-538.</bibl>
</p>

<p>
The principle of attraction might be extended so as to embrace all cases in which constructions are determined, not by strict logical or grammatical considerations, but by superficial associations (hypallage, etc.). Thus in
<bibl>Aj. 114.</bibl> <quote>τέρψις ἥδε σοι τὸ δρᾶν, ἥδε</quote> should have been ὧδε, but is <term>attracted</term> to the nearest word. In
<bibl>O. T. 1376.</bibl> <quote>(τέκνων ὄψις) βλαστοῦσα = βλαστόντων.</quote> And in
<bibl>Phil. 630.</bibl> <quote>δεῖξαι νεὼς ἄγοντα,</quote> the more exact construction would have been vηΐ depending on ἄγοντα, but δεῖξαι having come first, νεώς= ἐκ νεώς (supr. p. 10) in construction with δεῖξαι is preferred, i. e. δείξαι ἐκ νεὼς ἄγοντα ἐπὶ νηΐ. So an answer often follows the structure of the preceding speech though another construction would be more logical. Instances of this will be pointed out in the notes.

Uses of the Indicative.
</head>

<p>
 By the analogy of the well-known use of the past tenses of the indicative with ἵνα, ὡς, ὅπως to express a purpose, which is either <pb n="61"/>  in its nature impossible or contrary to fact, the same tenses appear, in two cases, to be employed in expressing with μή a negative wish applied to past time.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 539-41.</bibl> <quote>ἐδεξάμην | δῶρον, ὁ μήποτ᾽ ἐγὼ ταλακάρδιος | ἐπωφέλησα πόλεος ἐξελέσθαι</quote>-<gloss>A gift, which would that hapless I had not benefited the city so as to receive from her.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
  Here the place of the relative conjunction ὡς or ὅπως is supplied by the relative ὅ, and the unusual construction is perhaps assisted by an echo or <term>harmonic</term> from ἐπωφέλησα suggesting ὤφελον.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 1713.</bibl> <quote>ἰώ, μὴ γᾶς ἐπὶ ξένας θανεῖν ἔχρηζες</quote>-<gloss>Ah! would that thou hadst not desired to die on foreign soil.</gloss> Here the interjection takes the place of an introductory particle; and the harshness is again softened by the sound of ἔχρηζες suggesting ἐχρῆν σε. In both places μή is very emphatic. (Cp.
<bibl>Aesch. Choeph. 363</bibl> foll. μηδ᾽ ὑπὸ Τρωίας .. τέθαψαι).

DOUBLE AND FEEBLE CONSTRUCTIONS
</head>

<p>
  In the analysis of a Greek sentence, it is often difficult to determine with which of two words or clauses some word or clause is to be joined, and the true solution sometimes is that it has a connection with both, being joined with one in a primary, and with the other in a secondary construction. This is a general phenomenon, the observation of which is especially important in the more minute study of Sophocles. The poet or speaker has two constructions or rather analogies in his mind, and instead of deciding upon one or other of them, as would be done by a writer of a grammatical age, he fuses both together or allows the expression to shift from one to the other. The well-known οἶσθ᾽ ὡς ποίησον; (
<bibl>O. T. 543</bibl>), (a conversational idiom not confined to Sophocles), οἶσθ᾽ ὡς . . μὴ σφαλῇς; (
<bibl>O. C. 75</bibl>), are phrases obviously requiring some such explanation, viz. as a confusion of ποίησον and οἶσθ' ὡς ποιήσεις, etc. The tendency is one which prevails widely in the Greek of this period, and has a proportionate effect on the subtle language of Sophocles.

<bibl>Phil. 154 lyr.</bibl> <quote>τὸ γάρ μοι μαθεῖν οὐκ ἀποκαίριον. τὸ</quote> is (1) subj. of ἀποκαίριον (the inf. being epexegetic), or (2) object of μαθεῖν; i.e. the construction is ambiguous between τὸ γὰρ οὔκ ἐστιν ἀποκαίριόν μοι μαθεῖν, and οὔκ ἐστιν ἀποκαίριόν μοι μαθεῖν τό.

PARATAXIS
</head>

<p>
  While the subordination of sentences becomes more exact and complex, there remains, in Greek of all periods, a form of sentence, in which a notion essentially subordinate is coordinated with the main predication. A familiar example occurs in the New Testament, where the idiom is retained in the English Authorised Version: <gloss>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</gloss> Rom. vi. 17; cp. Matt. xi. 25. A parallel instance may also be quoted from Shak., Jul. Caes. i. 3: <quote>Let it be who it is, for Romans now | Have thews and sinews like their ancestors; | But, woe the while, our fathers' minds are dead.</quote> Cp. esp. <bibl>Il. 1.182</bibl> ff. ὡς ἔμ᾽ ἀφαιρεῖται Χρυσηίδα Φοίβος Ἀπόλλων, τὴν μὲν . . πέμψω, ἐγὼ δέ κ᾿ ἄγω Βρισηίδα, κ.τ.λ. <bibl>Plat. Rep. ii. 367 E</bibl>, καὶ ἐγὼ ἀκούσας ἀεὶ μὲν δὴ . . ἠγάμην, ἀτὰρ οὖν καὶ τότε ἥσθην, κ.τ.λ.

This is used by Sophocles to give additional point-

  Under this head are included those modes of expression which, though capable of being generally described, do not fall under any rule of syntax, and belong rather to the province of rhetoric than to that of grammar.

OXYMORON AND QUASI-OXYMORON
</head>

<p>
 The love of contrast and antithesis, which is part of the hyperlogical tendency of the Greek of this period, gives rise to minute oppositions and parallelisms of words which sometimes add little to the expression: as for instance in Κάδμου τοῦ πάλαι νέα τροφή (
<bibl>O. T. 1</bibl>): κακὸν κακῶς (
<bibl>Ib. 248</bibl>): στυγερὸν στυγερῶς (
<bibl>Phil. 166</bibl>): θυτῆρα καινῷ καινὸν ἐν πεπλώματι (
<bibl>Tr. 613</bibl>): ἀστὸς εἰς ἀστοὺς τελῶ (
<bibl>O. T. 222</bibl>): νέα νεόθεν (
<bibl>O. C. 1447</bibl>): νέος νέῳ ξὺν μόρῳ (
<bibl>Ant. 1266</bibl>): αὐτὴ πρὸς αὐτῆς (
<bibl>O. T. 1237</bibl>): ἐξ ἁπλῆς διπλῆ (
<bibl>Tr. 619</bibl>): τὰς οὔσας τέ μου | καὶ τὰς ἀπούσας ἐλπίδας (
<bibl>El. 305-306</bibl>): συμπεσὼν μόνος μόνοις (
<bibl>Aj. 467</bibl>): θάρσος .. τάρβους πέρι (
<bibl>El. 412</bibl>): ἀρίστου πατρὸς αἴσχιστος γεγώς (
<bibl>Phil. 1284</bibl>).
</p>

<p>
  [Cp. <bibl>Hdt. iv. 53.</bibl> <quote>καθαρὸς παρὰ θολεροῖσι.]</quote>
</p>

<p>
  To a similar fondness for comparisons and distinctions is attributable the use of τρίτος in such expressions as καὶ τὸ γενναῖον τρίτον (
<bibl>O. C. 8</bibl>): εἰ καὶ τρίτ᾽ ἐστί, <gloss>Be it second or third,</gloss> (
<bibl>O. T. 283</bibl>): and of δεύτερον, in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 325-326.</bibl> <quote>ὡς ὑμᾶς μόλις | εὑροῦσα λυπῇ δεύτερον μόλις βλέπω.</quote>
</p>

<p>
  Hence also the specially Greek figure of Oxymoron. Some wrongness or other strangeness is expressed through a contradiction in terms, in which qualities seemingly opposite are combined. (<bibl>Hdt. iii. 147.</bibl> <quote>μεμνημένος ἐπελανθάνετο.)</quote>
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="C.1.a" n="a">

<p>
The Aeschylean use of this figure is simple and rugged.
<bibl>Aesch. Prom. 904.</bibl> <quote>ἀπόλεμος ὅδε γ᾽ ὁ πόλεμος ἄπορα πόριμος</quote>-<gloss>A war not to be warred, plenteous in want of means.</gloss> Choeph. 42. τοιάνδε χάριν ἀχάριτον ἀπότροπον κακῶν-<gloss>To do such unblest grace for the averting of ill.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
  But in Sophocles this, like all else, is more subtly adapted to the expression of feeling.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 1214.</bibl> <quote>δικάζει τὸν ἄγαμον γάμον πάλαι | τεκνοῦντα καὶ τεκνού- μενον</quote>-<gloss>Condemns thee of long while being at once begetter and begotten in that horror of an unholy marriage.</gloss>

<bibl>O. C. 1549.</bibl> <quote>ὦ φῶς ἀφεγγὲς</quote>-<gloss>Light, of which I see no ray.</gloss>

</p>

<p>
  The nearest approach to the simplicity of Aeschylus or Herodotus is in the words of the chorus in-
<bibl>Phil. 848.</bibl> <quote>ὕπνος ἄυπνος λεύσσειν.</quote>

 In other instances the contradiction is less obvious, and depends upon some opposition of thought.

 Even further removed from the simple oxymoron, but still hingeing on the same principle of verbal contrast, are a kind of paradoxical expressions, in which a contradiction is hinted but not prominently brought out. These may be termed quasioxymora, and are often equivalent to a mere negative.

PROLEPSIS
</head>

<p>
   The concentrating effort of poetry, and especially of tragic poetry, leads to anticipatory forms of expression, called proleptic by the grammarians, in which things successive are treated as simultaneous, effects are viewed as concomitants, and results as attributes. Hence an adjective has sometimes in grammar the place of an epithet, which, in meaning, is really part of the predicate. Sophocles frequently has recourse to this means of presenting in a single moment what would seem more languid if expanded in the order of time.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 1200.</bibl> <quote>τῶν σῶν ἀδέρκτων ὀμμάτων τητώμενος.</quote>
<bibl>Tr. 106.</bibl> <quote>οὔ</quote>- ποτ᾿ εὐνάζειν ἀδακρύτων βλεφάρων πόθον.

  Such examples are to be carefully distinguished from the common supplementary predicate expressing result, as in-

ELLIPSE AND PLEONASM
</head>

<p>
 The remark which has been made with reference to the cases and prepositions (pp. 9, 27) may be applied more generally, viz. that the defect and redundancy in the language of this period arise from the same cause, the vivid realization of the elements of language combined with the incipient growth of reflection.
</p>

<p>
  The poetical impulse has also the two elements of condensation and fulness.
</p>

<p>
  Hence the figures of Ellipse and Pleonasm may be fairly combined under one heading.

     a. Of the indicative of εἰμί the 1st and 2nd persons are omitted in certain idioms as well as the third. This happens chiefly with common words such as ἕτοιμος, ἄξιος, but occurs also in other cases.

<p>
 The general tendency to omit or absorb the antecedent of a relative clause is extended by Sophocles to some exceptional cases, where the ellipse has the effect of throwing an emotional emphasis of some kind on the relative word. (See p. 33.)

PLEONASM
</head>

<p>
  Redundancy is natural to a language that is beginning to reflect upon itself. What was at first implicit seeks to become explicit, and finds reduplicated expression. The consciousness of imperfect utterance gives rise to supplementary words and phrases, not contemplated in the first formation of the sentence, which is expanded as it moves along (see above, pp. 27, 1; 37, a; 46, e); and the same analytical tendency which occasions the use of the auxiliary verb (see above, p. 56, 8) gives rise to many other periphrases, such as ἔθεσθ' ἐπιστροφήν (
<bibl>O. T. 134</bibl>), ποδοῖν ἄρθρα (ib. 1032, πίστιν φέρειν, etc.). Other forms of pleonasm are:-
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" xml:base="C.3.β.1" n="1">

<head>
Redundancy of the negative.
</head>

<p>
This has been already noticed (p. 48, 1, 49). One or two instances may be again given :-
<bibl>O. T. 57.</bibl> <quote>ἔρημος ἀνδρῶν μὴ ξυνοικούντων ἔσω.</quote>-μή brings out the negative implied in ἔρημος.

</p>

Redundancy of the antecedent.

<p>
The antecedent, though sufficiently indicated in the correlative clause, is sometimes further expressed by a pronoun, for the sake of clearness and point. (This is frequent in Plato, e. g. Theaet. 162, E. ἃ οἱ πολλοὶ ἂν ἀποδέχοιντο ἀκούοντες, λέγετε ταῦτα.)

<head>
ORDER OF WORDS AND EMPHASIS
</head>

<p>
   In language not yet reduced to grammatical precision, the interpreter should attend closely to the order of the words.
</p>

<p>
(1) The arrangement of the sentence corresponds more nearly than afterwards to the order in which the thoughts are suggested to the mind of the writer.
</p>

<p>
(2) There is more freedom used in the juxta-position of words for the sake of contrast or comparison or other association: because, the distinction of clauses being still incomplete, a parenthesis or subordinate clause (participial or otherwise) can be more easily interwoven with the principal clause, by the words of each being placed alternately. This has often the effect of producing a more equable or balanced rhythm; just as when in a single clause the words in agreement are separated. (
<bibl>O. T. 109.</bibl> <quote>ἴχνος παλαιᾶς δυστέκμαρτον αἰτίας.</quote>
<bibl>Ib. 1245.</bibl> <quote>τὸν ἤδη Λάϊον πάλαι νεκρόν.</quote>
<bibl>Aj. 311.</bibl> <quote>καὶ τὸν μὲν ἦστο πλεῖστον ἄφθογγος χρόνον.</quote>
<bibl>El. 730.</bibl> <quote>ναυαγίων Κρισαῖον ἱππικῶν πέδον.</quote>
<bibl>Tr. 436.</bibl> <quote>πρός σε τοῦ . . . Διός.)</quote>
</p>

<p>
(3) The exigencies, or, to speak more accurately, the proprieties of metre must be considered. Thus, the most emphatic position in an iambic line is in the first foot, which has the chief arsis: and, generally, the more emphatic word is placed first, although negatives and interrogatives, whose natural place is in the beginning of a sentence, are sometimes made more emphatic through being postponed.
</p>

<p>
(4) In judging of constructions in Sophocles, and also in determining the text, great weight must be given to the preservation of rhythm and also of a natural emphasis. That a reading has the effect of producing a strained or misplaced emphasis, or of weakening the chief emphasis by the addition of a too emphatic word, is an objection (whether to a reading or interpretation) of the most <pb n="77"/>   fatal kind. The language of Sophocles is seldom quite regular, but is always harmonious.
</p>

<p>
The following examples are intended to illustrate :-(α) The alternation of clauses. (β) The prominence of the emphatic word. (γ) The postponement of the interrogative or negative for the sake of emphasis. (δ) Separation of an emphatic word. (ε) Imperfect or borrowed emphasis.

 In a few instances a word has an imperfect or borrowed emphasis, i. e. is placed in an emphatic position by reason of an inexact antithesis, or because of the stress laid upon some other word. This, like many other irregularities, may be accounted for by the principle of attraction. See above, p. 60. A familiar <pb n="79"/>   proof of the same tendency in earlier Greek is the repetition of the personal pronoun in antitheses. (<bibl>Il. 1.184.</bibl> <quote>ἐγὼ δὲ κ᾿ ἄγω.)</quote>

  This arises partly from the love of antithesis, and partly from comparison and reflection. The mind in dwelling on a fact or supposition, reverts to what is opposite or correlative, and is thus led to refine upon the direct and natural mode of expression. (Compare Thucydides, e. g. i. 84. ἀμαθέστερον τῶν νόμων τῆς ὑπεροψίας παιδευόμενοι.) Hence

  Not far removed in principle from such inversions is the figure of Hypallage, by which an attribute properly applicable to the subordinate is attached to the principal word. This may also be viewed as a species of attraction. It has the effect of strengthening the language, by giving an impression of unity. (A good instance from earlier Greek is

CONDENSED EXPRESSION
</head>

<p>
   It has been already noticed (p. 39) that the attempt is sometimes made to condense a whole phrase into an adjective, and also (p. 74, 8) that Sophocles occasionally uses abbreviations, for which there may have been precedent in the idiom of conversation. It may now be stated more generally that the love of concentration often leads him to hint in a single phrase what could only be made explicit in a complicated sentence. This happens most frequently in the choral odes, where the vivid play of association supersedes conventional uses.

 Repetition after an interval.
</p>

<p>
  One point in which modern languages are more precise and exacting than the ancient is their sensitiveness in not allowing the same  <pb n="84"/>   word to be used twice, unless for special reasons, in the same passage. This requirement runs counter to a natural proclivity, as all must be aware who have had occasion to correct a hastily written letter. The word that has most recently passed through the mind is most likely to present itself for selection, though it is rejected by the instinct of a modern writer. But in Sophocles this tendency appears unchecked, and, whether from the vividness of the impression which accompanied each word, or from whatever cause, seems to have been unusually strong. A word once used is apt to be repeated in a different connection and even with a different meaning.

  The above examples, however, do not all belong to one and the same class. In the lyrical measures, a phrase of the strophe is often echoed in the antistrophe, which, according to a probable theory, may have been chanted by a different part of the chorus. In these cases the repetition is intentional: but in others it is accidental.
</p>

<p>
(2) A further instance of this inclination to repeat the sound, -ἥτις ἀειδόντεσσι νεωτάτη ἀμφιπέληται, -appears in the recurrence, at long intervals, and in quite different connections, of the same rare word, or of the same collocation of words, or of the same form of expression. Thus the Epic and lyric ἄфар occurs three times in the Trachiniae, and nowhere else in Sophocles. So ἢ ῥα, several times in the Ajax and in no other play. The hemistich θάρσει παρέσται occurs twice in the O. C. (305,726), and τὸ κλεινὸν Ἑλλάδος twice in the Electra (681, 694). So οὐδ᾽ ἀνίεσαν

(3) The Philoctetes, as already noticed (p. 27), is singular in having several instances (in the last commos) of tmesis of verbs compounded with ἀπό: and also in the frequent repetition of monosyllabic words in excited utterance. The following are examples of the latter tendency :-

</p>

<p>
 The reading in some of the above instances, as well as in others of this kind, has been doubted. But while it is freely admitted that the scribes may have sometimes repeated a word by mistake, it must be allowed, on the other hand, that the tendency in question is sufficiently evident to be taken into account. The context, with the analogy of other passages, must decide in each case whether the MS. reading is tenable. The repetition of the same word is of itself no objection to any reading.

Concluding Remarks on Grammatical Construction in Sophocles. In the preceding sections many idioms have been included which can be paralleled from other Greek writers, especially the tragedians; while, on the other hand, no collection of scattered instances can adequately represent the peculiarities of a writer whose strength lies in the <gloss>callida junctura,</gloss> and the subordination of parts to the whole. It has been impossible adequately to distinguish (a) between the remains of earlier syntax, and the novelties of the transition age; (6) between the phenomena of earlier Attic generally and those of the Tragic dialect; and (c) between the individual tendencies of Sophocles and those which he shares with Aeschylus or Euripides. But enough has probably been said to confirm the impression which many readers of Sophocles must have already formed, that the difficulties, inherent in the Greek of this period, which I attempted to characterize at the outset, are complicated in his case by a singular union of great subtilty with great simplicity.
</p>

<p>
This part of the subject may be appropriately concluded with a few general remarks.
</p>

<list>

<item>
1. Sophocles has the keenest feeling for the analogies of language.</item>
<item>
2. This subtle reflective tendency is perpetually causing slight modifications or extensions of idioms in ordinary use.</item>
<item>
3. The overlogical spirit, or κομψότης, of his day shows itself in various inversions, substitutions, and other indirect modes of expression.</item>
<item>
4. Also in minute verbal parallelisms, antitheses, and paradoxes, which, if somewhat strained in themselves, are made conducive to the principal effect.</item>
<item>
5. This analytical spirit is accompanied by a continual effort in the opposite direction of concentration.</item> <pb n="87"/>
<item>
6. From both the last mentioned causes there results a peculiar fulness and redundancy of expression, arising partly from the determination to be explicit, and partly from the combination and grouping of ideas.</item>
<item>
7. The singularity of Sophocles consists not in any or all of these characteristics, which are in some degree common to his age, but in his subtle treatment of them, the harmony in which he binds them together, and above all the grace with which he adapts them to the dramatic expression of natural human feeling.</item>
<item>
8. The relation of metre to language is not to be lost sight of. The word 'exigency' which is sometimes used in this connexion is inapplicable to a poet's work. But the correlation between speech and rhythm, as they react upon each other, is notwithstanding a reality. The Senarius for example, as compared with the Hexameter, is obviously favourable to compression, to connected periods, to synaphea, to the elaboration of a symmetrical and carefully articulated whole. Even the increase of contracted forms in Attic Greek may have owed something to the theatre as well as to the agora.</item>
<item>
9. The interpreter of Sophocles must think more of the sequence of ideas than of the apparent grammatical connexion of the words: and the critic of the text of Sophocles must ask, not, Is such and such a phrase exact in point of syntax? but, (1) Is it natural? (2) Is it poetical and rhythmical? (3) Is it dramatically suitable and expressive?</item> </list>

PART II.- PECULIARITIES OF DICTION.
</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">

<p>
 If the poet of a transition age in literature is less fettered than his predecessors or successors in the use of grammatical constructions, he enjoys a still more acknowledged liberty in the choice of words. It would seem at first sight as if all the resources of the spoken and written language were at the disposal of his invention. There are, however, limits to this freedom. No one now supposes, with Aristotle, that a great author ever absolutely created a new word; and if there are words in Shakespeare (e. g. <quote>blood-boltered,</quote> <quote>scamels</quote>) to the origin of which we have no clue, this is set to the account of our ignorance, and not of his caprice. It is true that the existence of inflexions in Greek, or rather the fresher consciousness of the meaning of inflexions, gave scope for a degree of licence which has never been possible in any modern language. But this licence is very sparingly employed, and is more seen in the use of compounds than in the formation of new derivatives from single stems. And even in the selection and adaptation of existing words, the innovations  <pb n="88"/>   of the poet are subject to the following conditions :-(1) They must be founded on the actual state of diction; (2) They must be more or less in accordance with prevailing tendencies; (3) Words taken from the early literature, or from a foreign dialect, must not be too far removed from customary use, and must be such as are already known in some way by those for whom the composition is intended. Much also depends on the kind of composition. Thus, words which are suitable to the style of a lyric ode would be out of place in tragic dialogue, many others are forbidden by proprieties of metre, and many expressions are appropriate in tragedy which an historical writer would reject as too ornamental for his purpose; although it is to be remembered that the distinction between poetry and prose was less absolute in the age of Sophocles than at a later time.
</p>

<p>
 Before entering on the consideration of the special peculiarities of any writer in point of diction, it would be well to have a clear and adequate conception of the vocabulary that lay at his command. To give this in the case of Sophocles, however, would be to produce, not one lexilogus, but several. The diction of the Iliad and still more of the Odyssey, that of the Epic Cycle, whose special peculiarities are unknown to us, that of the lyric poets, including Pindar, of the gnomic poets, including Theognis, Solon, and Simonides, must be presupposed. But Herodotus, who reflects the cultured intelligence of the Ionic cities in the former half of the fifth century в. с., is of more immediate importance for the study of tragic diction than any of these. In comparing him with Sophocles we are led to think that the Attic dialect, on which the Athenian agora and theatre worked many potent changes, must at first have had much more in common with the earlier Ionic than has been commonly imagined.<note n="1">The following words, amongst others, are at once Herodotean and Tragic:- ἀγηλατέω, ἁμαξεύομαι—ἐπαμαξεύομαι, ἀμήνιτος, ἀνέκαθεν, ἀνθυπουργέω, ἀπόνητος, ἀπότιμος, ἀπωστός, βιώσιμος (= βιωτός), βύσσινος, γενέτωρ, γνωσιμαχέω, ἔδαισα, διαλυμαίνομαι, δράμημα, δυσμορφία-δύσμορφος, δυσπετέως, ἑδώλια, ἐκπαγλέομαι, ἐλινύω, Ἑλλάς adj., ἐμφερής, ἐξανασπάω, ἐξανδρόομαι, ἐξεύρημα, έξογκόω, ἐξοπτᾶν, ἔπηλυς, εὐεστώ, εὔστομα (= εὔφημα), εὐσύμβλητος, εὐφρόνη, ζάπλουτος, ἡμερόσκοπος, θεήλατος, θέσπισμα.

<bibl>Ant. 908</bibl>, <bibl>Thuc. v. 105.</bibl>)
</p>

<p>
 The object of the following remarks, however, is not to treat the subject exhaustively, but to point out some of the respects in which the use of words in Sophocles is affected (1) by the stage of language in the age of Pericles, (2) by the poet's peculiar subtilty.
</p>

<p>
 The most general characteristic of the diction of Attic writers before Plato is an imperfect stage of abstraction. Many words are no longer found in the same simple concrete or metaphorical sense as in Homer: while, as contrasted with Xenophon or Demosthenes,  <pb n="89"/>   there is in these writers more of sensuous picturesqueness, and a richer colouring of association about single words, existing together with a certain vagueness and indefiniteness of meaning, especially in the use of words like γνώμη, θυμός, ὀργή, νοῦς, expressing mental states or faculties, and such as φύσις, χρόνος, νόμος, expressing abstract natures or ideas.
</p>

<p>
 In harmony with this state of diction was the prevailing tendency to modify and extend the use of words :-
<list>

<item>
(1) In the endeavour to express abstractions by participles, infinitives, neuter adjectives, and verbal nouns, leading sometimes to the substitution of a verbal noun for an infinitive, or of an infinitive or participle for a noun, and generally to the preference for verbal forms.</item>
<item>
(2) In giving a wider and more general meaning to specific words.</item>
<item>
(3) In arbitrarily assigning to generic words a specific meaning.</item>
<item>
(4) In exchanging the active, neuter, passive, and causative meanings of verbs.</item>
<item>
(5) In the attempt to analyse words, and to use them with (true or false) reference to their etymology.</item>
<item>
(6) In the use of compounds and other novel words, framed after the analogy of existing forms.</item>
<item>
(7) In giving an ethical force to words, whose meaning in the earlier language is merely physical.</item> </list>
</p>

<p>
 These tendencies appear in various modes in all the Attic writers of the fifth century B. c., especially in poetry. In Sophocles they take the peculiar bent of his genius. Not less bold and inventive than Aeschylus in his choice of words, where boldness is suitable, and more original than Euripides, he excels both in the adaptation of his diction to the expression of the finer shades of feeling. Without deserting simplicity, he keeps a rich variety of language in perfect harmony; while, especially in the lyric passages, he avails himself sometimes to an extreme of the suggestive power of many vocables, whose significance was not yet accurately defined. Some association, not perceived to be accidental, some echo of sound, some refinement on the obvious meaning, is made to float before the hearer's mind like the neutral tints which soften and harmonize the colouring of a picture. The same difficulty which attends the determination of construction in Sophocles is present also in the interpretation of single words, arising from the incomplete and fluent state of the language, in which the resolution of ambiguities, the distinction of synonyms, the antithesis of opposites, and the definition of abstract terms, were in an incipient stage, already engaging the activity of reflective thought and fancy, but not yet fixed in use or in theory. To this is added the difficulty, in interpreting a poet for whom treatises περὶ ποιητικῆς had no existence, of discerning the degree of figurativeness in his use of language. Sophocles is ante-rhetorical as well as ante-grammatical.
</p>

<p>
 Most words have been originally metaphors, and metaphors are continually falling into the rank of words. Often, indeed, when a poet has employed a metaphor which strikes the imagination of <pb n="90"/>   the reader or hearer with an impression of novelty, he will forthwith depart from it, regarding it as a mere vehicle of expression, and pass on to another, to which he is often drawn by the association of the first. Most instances of mixed metaphor (e. g. to take arms against a sea of troubles<gloss>$2</gloss>) are to be explained in this way. Often, too, just as the form of a sentence is altered in process of construction, a poetical image changes in the course of expression: e. g.  <cit><bibl>Shakespeare, Cymb. iv. 2</bibl><quote> <l part="F">O melancholy!</l> <l>Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find</l> <l>The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare</l> <l>Might easiliest harbour in?</l></quote> </cit>      Here melancholy is first a fathomless ocean, but is presently personified as one sailing over a shoreless sea. The imagination is not satisfied even with this, but goes on to suppose the sluggish barge of melancholy finding rest at last, if she can ever find it, against the oozy bank of some slow stream. The indefiniteness of the image is not a fault of style, but rather adds to the effect. So in the O. T. of Sophocles:- <cit><bibl>Soph. OT 23</bibl> <quote>     <l part="F">κἀνακουφίσαι κάρα</l>     <l>βυθῶν ἔτ᾽ οὐχ οἷα τε φοινίου σάλου,</l></quote> </cit>   where the city is first compared to a ship in distress, and the ship in distress is again compared to an animal all but devoured by some cruel monster, the confusion or reduplication of imagery, rendered easier by the frequency of the nautical metaphor (see below, p. 105), enhances the impressiveness of the passage.
</p>

<p>
 The following collection of instances is intended to illustrate (1) The experimental use of abstractions, including the modification in the meaning of words through ethical reflection : (2) The interchange of transitive, intransitive, and causative meanings: (3) Analytical or etymological uses: (4) Peculiarities of compounds and derivatives : (5) Sensuous and suggestive words: (6) Epic and Lyric words and phrases: (7) The use of metaphor.

<head>
EXPERIMENTAL USE OF ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONS
</head>

<p>
  It is sometimes said that poetry abhors abstractions. And this is true in the sense that technical terms, whose meaning has been defined by systematic reasoning, are generally unsuited to the expression of feeling. But if feeling does not choose to borrow from the logical faculty, this is because feeling has her own way of generalizing. And reflective poetry, whether subjective or dramatic, in seeking to idealize feeling, is ever rising into the region of general ideas. (See above, pp. 30, 44.) Hence the partial abstractions which abounded in the time of Sophocles are seized by him as welcome materials for his art. They harmonize with its ideal character, while they assist concentration, and give an air of severity, without detracting from the effect of naturalness and pathos. <pb n="91"/>
</p>

<p>
 Occasionally, in the less impassioned places, he reproduces perhaps too exactly the sophistical spirit. But more frequently he adapts this feature of the language to his purposes with his usual skill.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.I.α" n="α">

<p>
 Certain notions, which have a wide range of application, are more completely generalized than in an earlier period, and have also more of a substantial or personal reality than would be attributed to them by a later writer. Such are νόμος, δίκη, καιρὸς χρόνος.

</p>

<p>
  In this and some other passages the idea of time, although personified, is quite general. (In
<bibl>El. 179 lyr.</bibl> <quote>χρόνος γὰρ εὐμαρὴς θεός,</quote> the personification is complete.) In other cases χρόνος, like αἰών, is not dissociated from the continuance of a single life (
<bibl>O. C. 7-8.</bibl> <quote>χὡ χρόνος ξυνὼν | μακρός :</quote>
<bibl>Ib. 930.</bibl> <quote>ὁ πληθύων χρόνος:</quote> cp. О. Т. 1082. οἱ δὲ συγγενεῖς | μῆνές με μικρὸν καὶ μέγαν διώρισαν), and in one passage the meaning seems to be similarly limited to the duration of the race of men-

<p>
 Other words appear to be in an earlier stage of abstraction.
</p>

<p>
  φύσις,
</p>

<p>
  for example, occurs nowhere in the philosophical sense of universal nature; but means always some particular nature, constitution, birth, or origin. The place where the word has the highest degree of generality is
<bibl>Aj. 760.</bibl> <quote>ὅστις ἀνθρώπου φύσιν | βλαστών</quote>-· Who having sprung in the nature of man.<gloss>Other uses of φύσιν and φύσει, ‘by birth, by constitution, by nature, by disposition,</gloss> etc., present various degrees of imperfect abstraction from the meaning of the verbal noun.

<p>

  in the singular as well as in the plural is sometimes almost equivalent to the abstract <gloss>mankind.</gloss> Still, though the meaning is general, a typical individual is presented to the imagination.

<p>
 But the incompleteness and indefiniteness of abstractions is chiefly seen in words denoting mental acts and states, such as θυμός, φρόνησις, γνώμη, ὀργή, πόθος, ἐλπίς, ἔρως; or mental powers, such as νοῦς, ψυχή, καρδία, φρήν. Such words are used without the exactness of distinction which was afterwards introduced by reflection and use, the shade of meaning intended being left to be determined by the context:-and they are accompanied with a peculiar feeling of the wonderful nature of man. This phase of ethical or psychological language is familiar to the student of Thucydides, and it is immediately obvious how large must be its <pb n="92"/>   application to the purposes of the dramatic poet. In Sophocles there are various grades of ethical significance, from the simplest lyrical personification, as in
<bibl>El. 198.</bibl> <quote>δόλος ἦν ὁ φράσας, ἔρος ὁ κτείνας,</quote> to such quasi-scientific discrimination of terms as in
<bibl>Ant. 176.</bibl> <quote>ψυχήν τε καὶ φρόνημα καὶ γνώμην,</quote> where however the sophistical parade of words is merely a piece of mannerism, and the attempt to distinguish accurately the connotation of the several terms is not only difficult but illusory.
</p>
<milestone unit="section" n="49"/>
<p>
 It will be sufficient to adduce one or two examples of the use of such words in Sophocles. A glance at any lexicon to Sophocles will suggest many others.

<p>
 θυμός occurs once only in the seven plays in the sense of <gloss>mind</gloss> or <gloss>memory,</gloss> and in this there is probably a reminiscence of Homer.
<bibl>El. 1347.</bibl> <quote>οὐδέ γ᾽ ἐς θυμὸν φέρω</quote>-<gloss>Nor can I bring him to my mind.</gloss> (Cp. Fr. 595. πόλλ᾽ ἐν κακοῖσι θυμὸς εὐνηθεὶς ὁρᾷ.)
</p>

<p>
  Nearly the same form is used by Jocasta in
<bibl>O. T. 975.</bibl> <quote>μή νυν ἔτ᾿ αὐτῶν μηδὲν ἐς θυμὸν βάλῃς. But here θυμός is associated, as it is almost everywhere in Attic Greek, with the emotional nature. Not,</quote> <gloss>Do not cast it in your mind,</gloss> (as in <bibl>Hdt. i. 84</bibl>, ἐφράσθη καὶ ἐς θυμὸν ἐβάλετο:
<bibl>Aesch. P. V. 706</bibl>, <quote>τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους | θυμῷ βάλ',) but rather,</quote> <gloss>Do not take it to heart.</gloss> Cp. ἐνθύμιον,
<bibl>Aesch. P. V. 739</bibl> <quote>: ὑψοῦ γὰρ αἴρει θυμόν,</quote>
<bibl>Aesch. P. V. 914.</bibl> <quote>In this last instance θυμός is not thought or feeling simply, but the mind agitated by feeling; i.e. in the present case by</quote> <gloss>doubts and fears.</gloss> <gloss>Oedipus lets his mind be lifted into high suspense by all manner of griefs.</gloss> Here θυμός (cp. φρήν,
<bibl>Tr. 982</bibl>,
<bibl>O. C. 1182</bibl>; βίοτος,
<bibl>O. T. 612</bibl>; αἰών,
<bibl>Phil. 1348</bibl>) is spoken of as a real thing or substance, as if separable from the person himself. θυμός is elsewhere the seat or origin of particular emotions, as <gloss>desire,</gloss>
<bibl>O. C. 778</bibl>,
<bibl>El. 286</bibl>; <gloss>fear,</gloss>
<bibl>O. C. 1466</bibl>, <quote>ἔπτηξα θυμόν;</quote> <gloss>anger,</gloss>
<bibl>El. 331</bibl>, cp.
<bibl>Phil. 324</bibl>; and <gloss>courageous ardour</gloss> or 'confidence,
<bibl>El. 26.</bibl> <quote>θυμὸν οὐκ ἀπώλεσεν :</quote>
<bibl>Aj. 1124.</bibl> <quote>ἡ γλῶσσά σου τὸν θυμὸν ὡς δεινὸν τρέφει.</quote>
</p>

<p>
  This meaning of θυμός, as a principle, is not always easy to distinguish from the more special, and in Attic Greek the more common meaning, of a state or condition of anger. Instances in which it has been supposed to mean anger, but where it more probably means an angry or agitated mind, are-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Ant. 493.</bibl> <quote>φιλεῖ δ᾽ ὁ θυμὸς πρόσθεν ᾑρῆσθαι κλοπεὺς | τῶν μηδὲν ὀρθῶς ἐν σκότῳ τεχνωμένων</quote>-<gloss>And when men are plotting wrong in secret, their distracted mind is oft convicted of concealment before the act.</gloss>
<bibl>Ib. 1097.</bibl> <quote>ἀτῇ πατάξαι θυμόν -</quote> <gloss>To bring down the blow of calamity on the passionate heart.</gloss>
<bibl>Aj. 954.</bibl> <quote>ἢ ῥα κελαινώπαν θυμὸν ἐφυβρίζει πολύτλας ἀνήρ.</quote>
<bibl>O. C. 434.</bibl> <quote>όπηνίκ᾽ ἔζει θυμός.</quote>
<bibl>Ib. 438.</bibl> <quote>κἀμάνθανον τὸν θυμὸν ἐκδραμόντα μοι | μείζω κολαστὴν τῶν πρὶν ἡμαρτημένων, where τὸν θυμόν may be rendered,</quote> <gloss>My passionate mood.</gloss> <pb n="93"/>
</p>

<p>
  In the more limited sense of a condition of anger, θυμός becomes again <gloss>hypostatized,</gloss> and is spoken of as a separate nature or idea.
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. T. 673.</bibl> <quote>ὅταν | θυμοῦ περάσῃς. γῆράς ἐστιν ἄλλο πλὴν | θανεῖν.</quote>

νοῦς, which is commonly, and in later Greek exclusively, an intellectual principle, in
<bibl>Ant. 767</bibl> is used for θυμόςνοῦς δ᾽ ἐστὶ τηλικοῦτος ἀλγήσας βαρύς.
</p>

<p>
  The danger suggested by the chorus, however, lies not only in the resentment of Haemon, but in the invention and contrivance which the resentment sets to work. Cp. also
<bibl>El. 913.</bibl> <quote>μητρὸς οὔθ᾽ ὁ νοῦς φιλεῖ | τοιαῦτα πράσσειν.</quote>

  The meaning of this word, like that of θυμός, is intermediate between a principle or faculty and a condition or state.

 The vagueness of abstract notions, and the tendency to form them, together with the absence of definitions, lead to the extension of words from a special to a more general meaning, and also to the specializing of general words, for want of the distinctions that are required for the exact expression of a specific idea.

   Even words of such general meaning as πράσσω, πρᾶξις, ἔργον, ἐσθλός, κακός, are often used by Sophocles, where a specific expression would be required in any modern language. See esp.
<bibl>Aj. 132-133.</bibl> <quote>τοὺς δὲ σώφρονας | θεοὶ φιλοῦσι καὶ στυγοῦσι τοὺς κακούς,</quote> where κακούς is made the contrary of σώφρονας, a more specific word. Sometimes the specific meaning intended is not strictly contained in the generic word employed. See e.g.
<bibl>Tr. 887</bibl>, where ὕβρις is applied to suicide; and
<bibl>Phil. 207</bibl>, where ἀνάγκη is used for extreme difficulty.

 On the other hand, some words are made to drop their particular significance and to express a simple and general idea.
</p>

<p>
  The most obvious example of this is in the number of words which are almost equivalent to εἰμί :-βεβηκέναι, ἥκειν, καθεστάναι, ἑστάναι, κεῖσθαι, πέλειν, τυγχάνειν, κυρεῖν, φαίνεσθαι, which have always some special appropriateness to the context in which they are found, but hardly convey more than the simple meaning of the substantive verb.

<p>
Other instances are the use of ἁπλοῦς as almost equivalent to εἷς, δεδορκέναι for ζῆν (

INTERCHANGE OF ACTIVE, NEUTER, AND CAUSAL MEANINGS
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="53"/>
<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.II.a" n="a">

<p>
 The transitive use of intransitive verbs is rare, except in constructions πρὸς τὸ σημαινόμενον, such as
<bibl>El. 147.</bibl> <quote>ἀλλ᾿ ἐμέ γ' ἁ στονόεσσ᾽ ἄραρεν φρένας (</quote>see above, p. 23). For the cognate accusative after neuter verbs, see above, p. 24.
</p>

<p>
A clear instance of a neuter verb used actively is in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>O. C. 1282.</bibl> <quote>ἢ δυσχεράναντ' -</quote> <gloss>Or having moved dislike.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
  The adjectives διάτορος, ὁμόσπορος, ὁμογενής, νομάς, δύσφορος, νηλής, ἡλιοστερής, ὀκνηρός, εὐτυχής, and others, are used sometimes in an active as well as in a neuter or passive sense. (In some cases, of course (διατόρος, etc.), the accentuation is changed.)
</p>

<p>
  The verbal μεμπτός has an active meaning in-
</p>

<p>

<bibl>Tr. 445-446.</bibl> <quote>ὥστ᾽ εἴ τι τὠμῷ τ᾽ ἀνδρὶ τῇδε τῇ νόσῳ | ληφθέντι μεμπτός εἰμι, κάρτα μαίνομαι.</quote> Cp. ὑπέροπτα,
<bibl>O. T. 883</bibl>, ἀμφιπλήκτων,
<bibl>Phil. 687.</bibl>
</p>

<p>
  Other verbal adjectives, and derivatives of verbal adjectives, are used with meanings not directly passive, e. g. ῥιπτός, i. e. διὰ ῥιπῆς γενόμενος,
<bibl>Tr. 357</bibl> <quote>; λωβητός,</quote> i. e. λωβὴν ἔχων,
<bibl>Ib. 538</bibl>; ἀμφίπλεκτος, i. e. ὑπ᾿ ἀμφιπλεκόντων ἀλλήλοις περαινόμενος,
<bibl>Ib. 520.</bibl>
</p>

<p>
  The rare active forms ἅζειν,
<bibl>O. C. 134</bibl>, μηχανᾶν,
<bibl>Aj. 1037</bibl> (cp. Hom. <bibl>Od. 18.143</bibl>), are adapted to the places where they occur, in both of which the active voice gives absoluteness to the expression. See above, p. 51.
</p>

<p>
  σέβω, <gloss>to revere,</gloss> and so absolutely to shew piety,'

<bibl>Tr. 535.</bibl> <quote>συγκατοικτιουμένη-</quote> <gloss>To claim for myself your sympathy and pity.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
In
<bibl>El. 162 lyr.</bibl> <quote>Διὸς εὔφρονι βήματι, either the verbal noun is causative,</quote> <gloss>Zeus propitiously causing him to come,</gloss> or the causative meaning is contained in the genitive, <gloss>With propitious coming sped by Zeus.</gloss> The former agrees best with εὔφρονι.
</p>

<p>
 The intransitive or absolute use of verbs commonly transitive is much more frequent: e. g. κρύπτειν,

</p>

<p>

<bibl>El. 720.</bibl> <quote>For other intransitive uses of ἔχειν, see above, p. 96. κάμπτειν (SC. κῶλα),</quote> <gloss>to rest,</gloss>

ANALYTICAL OR ETYMOLOGICAL USES
</head>
  <milestone unit="section" n="54"/>
<p>
 While usage was comparatively unfixed and reflection was already actively employed on language, there was a natural tendency to make experiments through the analysis of words. Having more of the original meaning than afterwards, words can be used more freely, and thus admit of wider application; while on the other hand they are objects of curiosity, and attention is drawn to their essential significance. One case of this analytical activity has been already noticed (p. 27, B), where the preposition in composition acquires a separate force.
<bibl>O. T. 175.</bibl> <quote>ἄλλον δ᾽ ἂν ἄλλῳ προσίδοις.</quote>
<bibl>Tr. 842.</bibl> <quote>μεγάλαν προσορῶσα δόμοις βλάβαν.</quote>
<bibl>Phil. 320.</bibl> <quote>συντυχών κακῶν | ἀνδρῶν Ἀτρειδῶν.</quote>

</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.III.a" n="a">

<p>
 Through this tendency, combined with that towards verbal expressions (p. 93), nouns originally verbal, which have come simply to designate an object, regain their verbal force.
</p>

<p>
  ὄμμα (from stem ὄπτ-) is generally <gloss>the eye:</gloss> but in Sophocles is also (1) <gloss>a look,</gloss>
<bibl>Aj. 193</bibl>,
<bibl>Tr. 914.</bibl> <quote>λαθραῖον ὄμμ᾽ ἐπεσκιασμένη. (2)</quote> <gloss>Power of insight,</gloss>
<bibl>Ib. 1018.</bibl> <quote>σοί τε γὰρ ὄμμα | ἔμπλεον ἢ δι᾽ ἐμοῦ σώζειν. (3)</quote> An object of vision,
<bibl>Aj. 1004.</bibl> <quote>ὦ δυσθέατον ὄμμα καὶ τόλμης πικρᾶς. (4) The</quote> <gloss>effluence</gloss> from the object (see Plato, Men. 76 D),
<bibl>El. 902.</bibl> <quote>ἐμπαίει τί μοι | ψυχῇ σύνηθες ὄμμα. (5) ‘</quote>Appearance,
<bibl>Tr. 379.</bibl> <quote>ἢ κάρτα λαμπρὰ καὶ κατ᾿ ὄμμα καὶ φύσιν. (6)</quote> <gloss>Light,</gloss> in a metaphorical sense, as giving joy,
<bibl>Ib. 203.</bibl> <quote>ὡς ἄελπτον ὄμμ᾽ ἐμοὶ | φήμης ἀνασχὸν τῆσδε νῦν καρπούμεθα. (7)</quote> With ethical or pathetic associations,
<bibl>Aj. 140.</bibl> <quote>πτηνῆς ὡς ὄμμα πελείας :</quote>
<bibl>Tr. 527-528.</bibl> <quote>τὸ δ᾽ ἀμφινείκητον ὄμμα νύμφας | ἐλεινὸν ἀμμένει:</quote> Aj .977. ὦ ξύναιμον ὄμμ᾽ ἐμοί : cp.
<bibl>Phil. 171.</bibl> <quote>μηδὲ σύντροφον ὄμμ᾽ ἔχων.</quote>
</p>

<p>
  So θρέμμα, generally, that <gloss>which is nourished up,</gloss> <gloss>a creature.</gloss> But from the association of τρέφεσθαι, <gloss>to clot together</gloss> (whence θρόμβος), in
<bibl>Tr. 574.</bibl> <quote>θρέμμα λερναίας ὕδρας</quote> is partly the venom nursed in the hydra, partly (cp. supr. 572, ἀμφίθρεπτον αἷμα) the poison clotted about the wound.
</p>

<p>
  βορά, which commonly means <gloss>food,</gloss> in
<bibl>Ant. 1017</bibl> <quote>means</quote> <gloss>eating.</gloss> Cp. <bibl>Hdt. i. 119.</bibl> <quote>ὡς δὲ τῷ Ἁρπάγῳ ἐδόκεε ἅλις ἔχειν τῆς βορῆς.</quote>

 Sometimes a word has more than one association. E. g. :-
</p>

<p>
  καλλιστεία is properly the prize for beauty or nobleness, but in
<bibl>Aj. 435</bibl>, is rather the prize of the most beautiful, the most beautiful given as a prize.
</p>

<p>
  πάραυλος, as derived from αὐλός, properly means <gloss>out of tune,</gloss> but in
<bibl>Aj. 892</bibl> <quote>seems to mean</quote> <gloss>neighbouring,</gloss> from παρά, αὐλή, with the additional meaning (from αὐλός) of <gloss>sounding near.</gloss> So in
<bibl>O. T. 186.</bibl> <quote>ὅμαυλος means (1) ' in the same dwelling, but also (2)</quote> <gloss>sounding together, blending.</gloss>
</p>

<p>
  ἰός in
<bibl>Tr. 833</bibl> <quote>means</quote> <gloss>poison</gloss> as in 771, but with an allusion to the poisoned arrow, which is also iós (
<bibl>Ib. 574</bibl>).
</p>

<p>
  προπετές in
<bibl>Tr. 701</bibl> <quote>is (1)</quote> <gloss>fallen to the earth;</gloss> (2) <gloss>on the point of disappearing.</gloss>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.III.c" n="c">

<p>
 This kind of confusion is more apt to occur in the case of words not in familiar use, such as ἀμενηνός, used in Epic poetry of the dead, from a, μένος, <gloss>without strength:</gloss> applied by Sophocles to Ajax (
<bibl>Aj. 890</bibl>), with an association from a, μένω, <gloss>having no abiding place.</gloss> Ajax escapes their search as the shade of a dead man fleets from the embrace of his friend. (A similar process is observable in modern languages. Thus <quote>shamefast</quote> has been transformed to <quote>shamefaced,</quote> and words like <gloss>aufheben,</gloss> <gloss>beziehung,</gloss> receive their second intention in German philosophy.)
</p>

<p>
  ἀμφίγυος is properly <gloss>two-edged,</gloss> of a weapon, but in

ANALYTICAL OR ETYMOLOGICAL USES
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="55"/>
<p>
 Ionic Greek as well as Attic poetry delights in compounds, and tragedy retains considerable freedom in their use, although from frequent repetition the less emphatic element in a compound word is often comparatively insignificant. (Cp. the following Hesiodic compounds, ἀδώτης, ἀμβολιεργός, πρωτηρότης, ἀκροκνέφαιος, ὀρθρόγοος, ἡμερό- κοιτος, and words like αὐτογενής, κρεισσότεκνος in Aeschylus.)

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.1" n="">

<p>
There is more freedom than appears afterwards in compounding stems with prepositions, especially ἐκ and ἐν. Thus, ἀναδοχή, ἀποβλαστάνω, ἀπορθόω (cp. <bibl>Plat. Legg. 757 E</bibl>), ἐκθεῶμαι, ἐκκομπάζω, ἐκλήγω, ἐκλωβάω, ἐκλωπίζω, ἐκπέλει=ἔξεστι, ἐκπροτιμῶ, ἐκχράω, ἔμπολις, ἔνεδρος, ἐνθακέω, ἐνθαλάσσιος, ἐξαμαρτία, ἐξατιμάζω, ἐξαπεῖδον, ἐξαυδάω, ἐξελευθεροστομέω, ἐξευτρεπίζω, ἐξεφίεμαι, ἐξικετεύω, ἐξοικήσιμος, ἐξόμιλος, ἐξύπερθε, καταυδάω, are all new compounds.

A complex predicate or attribute is sometimes expressed by a rare compound; e.g. ἀνάνδρωτος, ἀριστόχειρ, ἀρτίκολλος, ἀρτίχριστος, ἀρχέπλουτος, δίπαλτος, δολόμυθος, ἡδύπολις, κοινότοκος, λιθόλευστος, μελάγχολος, σιτόνομος, τελεόμηνος, τρυσάνωρ, ὑψίπολις, χαλαργός, χαλκόπλακτος.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.IV.3" n="3">

<p>
On the other hand, a simple attribute is often expressed by a compound adjective, the inferior part of which repeats some notion which is already implied in the noun or other neighbouring word. This is especially frequent with the compounds of πούς; e.g. δεινόπους ἀρά (ἐλᾷ), χαλκόπους ὀδός (threshold of brazen floor), ὠκύπους ἀγών, νόμοι πρόκεινται ὑψίποδες, κοινόπους παρουσία, δολιόπους ἀρωγός. Other combinations are δυσπάρευνον λέκτρον, λαθί- πονον ὀδυνᾶν, πολυθύτους σφαγάς (
<bibl>Tr. 791</bibl>, 1021, 756), ἄνδρ᾽ ἕν οἰόζωνον (
<bibl>O. T. 846</bibl>), πυκνόπτεροι ἀηδόνες (
<bibl>O. C. 17-18</bibl>). But though frequently redundant, the less prominent part of a compound is hardly ever wholly irrelevant in Sophocles.

SENSUOUS AND SUGGESTIVE WORDS

  <milestone unit="section" n="56"/>
<p>
 The diction of Sophocles is abstract and concentrated, but not colourless. A single word of his often calls up a picture, and his airiest and most refined conceptions have concrete expression. His language has the picturesqueness of Herodotus, subtly transfused with reflective thought.

 It is difficult to treat this subject without trenching on the cognate department of metaphorical language. (See below, p. 105.)

 Favourite words denoting colour and form, such as κελαινός, χλωρός, κοῖλος, are often made to suggest more than they express. The disparity between the impressions of colour and form, which were rich and deep, and the vagueness and inarticulateness of the language which described them, may have helped this tendency. <gloss>The dark point of the champion spear,</gloss> κελαινὰ λογχά,
<bibl>Tr. 856</bibl>, <quote>suggests the stains of many combats; the</quote> <gloss>blue-grey vintage,</gloss> γλαυκὴ ὀπώρα,

<bibl>O. T. 211</bibl>, reminds us of the dark-red wine.
</p>

<p>
 χλωρός, <gloss>grass-green,</gloss> is applied (1) to the dew of tears (
<bibl>Tr. 847</bibl>); (2) to life-blood (
<bibl>Ib. 1055</bibl>); (3) to the sea-sand (
<bibl>Aj. 1064</bibl>). The association in the first passage seems to be that of tenderness and softness (τέρεν, θαλερὸν δάκρυ); in the second that of freshness and young vigour; the exact meaning of the word in the third case is doubtful. Perhaps the pale <gloss>yellow</gloss> sand, perhaps the moist,' smooth and glistering sand.

 A favourite word denoting form is κοῖλος. It is applied as an ornamental epithet to the couch which is to receive the pressure of Heracles,
<bibl>Tr. 901</bibl>; to the vale of Argos,
<bibl>O. C. 378</bibl>; to the bowl of Theseus and Pirithous,

<bibl>Aj. 1403</bibl>; and to the casket of Deianira,

<bibl>O. C. 1596</bibl>; of the stony receptacle of Antigone,

<p>
 Influence of association on the choice of words.
</p>

<p>
  In many passages of the choric songs, as in all lyric poetry, the connection of ideas is often guided rather by association than by any regular sequence either of thought or fact. A typical instance of this is supplied by the stasimon of the Trachiniae in which the long chain of causes which have led to the pain of Heracles are crushed together in a few words so that the links can hardly be separated (
<bibl>Tr. 836-40</bibl>): <gloss>He is steeped in the dreadful apparition of the Hydra,</gloss> i. e. his veins are saturated with poison from the wound made by the arrow of Hercules, which he had steeped in the venom of the Hydra, that dreadful monster. <gloss>And mingled therewith the murderous stings of crafty speech from the Centaur burst forth upon him and torment him;</gloss> i. e. this poison, which breaks out in stinging sores, was applied in consequence of the guileful advice of the Centaur, given with intent to cause his death, and this fact adds <pb n="104"/> to the cruelty of the torment. The attentive consideration of this passage may prepare the way for an interpretation of Antigone 599-603, which might otherwise appear strained :— <gloss>The light of life that still was spread above the last remaining fibre of the stock of Oedipus, is again swept down (see notes in loco) by the dust consecrated to the infernal gods, which is (1) bloodstained, (2) cruel (both expressed in powía), and by madness of thought and infatuation of mind;</gloss> i. e. By sprinkling dust on Polynices, to which she is prompted by mad reasoning and heaven-sent fury, Antigone is herself overwhelmed by the dust of death, so quenching the last hope of the house of Oedipus. When thus read in the light of association, the words are seen to be more harmonious than if κόνις be exchanged for κόπις, which introduces a grotesque and commonplace image that has nothing to do with the story.

EPIC AND LYRIC WORDS AND PHRASES
</head>

<p>
<milestone unit="section" n="57"/>  That a large element of Tragic Greek is derived from Epic and Lyric poetry is a patent fact. Whether words and phrases which Sophocles has in common with Homer were taken by him from the Iliad and Odyssey, or from some other source, cannot clearly be determined. The following are a few typical examples of Epic and Lyric diction.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.1" n="1">

<p>
 Words and phrases seeming to be directly borrowed from the Epic diction are ἀμφηκής, ἀνάρσιος, ἕκατι, ἦμος, ὁδίτης, ῥίγησαν, ὠρώρει, ἀμφιχανών, ἄναλκις, ἀπείργαθον, ἀτίζω; ἀτρύγετος, Fr. 423; αὖθι, Fr. 468 ; βαθύρρους; πολύτλας (of Odysseus); ναμέρτεια (from νημερτής); κοίλην κάπετον; ὦ μοι ἐγώ, τί πάθω ; ἐνέδησεν ἄτα.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.2" n="2">

<p>
 Sometimes an Epic word is used, but with some modification of meaning; e. g. θοὰν νύμφαν, <gloss>a bride swiftly borne;</gloss> ἀμενηννὸν ἄνδρα, <gloss>the lost hero;</gloss> λakev, sounded forth,' of an oracle; didnλos, κλυτός, ἀριφραδής, ἐν φίλαισι χερσίν (
<bibl>El. 1138</bibl>).
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.3" n="3">

<p>
 Or an Attic phrase is so turned as to recal the Homeric idiom, as in ἐπίπονον ἡμέραν like δούλιον ἦμαρ, Ἰφίτου βίαν like βίη Ηρακληείη, φίλτατον .. κάρα like φίλη κεφαλή, δι' αἰθέρα τεκνωθέντες, cp. αὐθρηγενής. With these may be classed such epithets, having an Epic colouring, as πάτραν διήνεμον,
<bibl>Tr. 327</bibl>; νηὶ ποικιλοστόλῳ,
<bibl>Phil. 343.</bibl>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.4" n="4">

<p>
 Many words are used which are common to Epic and Lyric, but rare in Attic Greek; e. g. ἄφαρ, ἀφνεός, ὁρῶμαι (middle voice), ἀτάλλω, ζαμενής, αἴθων, ἀμαιμάκετος, ἀντάω (=τυγχάνω), ἀτύζεσθαι, πορεῖν, οὔλιος, ἠπύω, ὀμφή, αἰπύς, ἦ ῥα, ἐπίηρα φέρειν, αἰνός, χρύσεος (*), <gloss>glorious,</gloss> χάλκεος, <gloss>indestructible.</gloss>
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.5" n="5">

<p>
 Others are Lyric but not Epic:-βαρυαχής, καλλιβόας, πολύπονος.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VI.6" n="6">

<head>
KINDS AND DEGREES OF METAPHOR
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="58"/>
<p>
 The language of Sophocles is for the most part not highly figurative. But some images are so familiar in Attic poetry that they almost cease to be metaphors, and (see above, p. 92) are to be viewed merely as words. The tendency to abstraction, giving the power of fixing the attention on the leading notion of a word, apart from the particular associations, contributed to this.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.1" n="1">

<p>
 The most familiar of all images to an Athenian audience were those connected with the sea. Such expressions as <gloss>The haven of a cry,</gloss> <gloss>Sailing into a harbourless marriage,</gloss> <gloss>The long and rough voyage from Thebes to Athens,</gloss> are less figurative in Attic Greek than they would be in other languages. (Cp. <bibl>Hdt. iii. 155</bibl>, <quote>§ 3. ἐξέπλωσας τῶν φρενῶν.) When we speak of a government being wrecked on a certain measure, our imagination seldom reverts to the figure of a shipwreck, or of a sunken rock, and something of the kind is true of the use of λιμήν, ὅρμος, σαλεύω, ὀρθόω (to right the vessel), πλοῦς, ξύμπλους, οὖρος, κατουρίζω, ἐρέσσειν, and the like words in Sophocles. This nautical imagery is a vehicle of expression which is always at hand. Hence, while mixed metaphors are allowable, and the figurative language is often not to be pressed, an occasional hyperbolical boldness is easily accounted for.</quote> <gloss>The whole Crissean plain was filled with equestrian shipwrecks.</gloss> <gloss>He avoided the boiling surge of horses with their riders</gloss> (
<bibl>El. 729-733</bibl>). The same remark applies in a less degree to other familiar aspects of life, such as war, the public games, wrestling, running, archery, health and disease, fair weather and storm, ploughing, sowing, reaping, etc.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.2" n="2">

<p>
 Another kind of familiarity belonged to images that had been used in the earlier poetry. Such figures as the <gloss>cloud of grief,</gloss> or <gloss>the fire of destruction,</gloss> <gloss>he grew up like a young plant,</gloss> which had been consecrated by Homer, could be handled with greater freedom than those which were of recent invention, such as <gloss>The unbending oak borne down by the torrent.</gloss> (
<bibl>Ant. 714.</bibl><quote>) They could be extended and modified like grammatical idioms and the uses of words. This cause also gives rise to mixtures or transitions of metaphor,</quote> <gloss>Guile-woven fate anoints him with the Centaur's gory cloud,</gloss> <gloss>My cloud of darkness coming over me, like a ship wafted by too sure a gale,</gloss> <gloss>The battle God is burning me with shouts of onset.</gloss> (
<bibl>Tr. 831</bibl>,
<bibl>O. T. 1314</bibl>,
<bibl>Ib. 191.</bibl>)
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.VII.3" n="3">

<p>
There is also a class of words originally metaphorical, which are not felt to be so, because the analogy on which their meaning rests is not sufficiently remote to give the impression of poetical imagery. These can hardly be distinguished from the generalized uses mentioned in p. 94. Such expressions as <gloss>to merchandize advantage,</gloss> <gloss>to feed on hopes,</gloss> <gloss>to bind in a tomb-like chamber,</gloss> <gloss>the oared vehicle of a ship,</gloss> <gloss>to give the ship her head</gloss> (ναῒ μεθεῖναι), although not literal, are hardly figurative.

 The Peculiarities of Language in Sophocles considered with reference to the settlement of the Text.
</head>
 <milestone unit="section" n="59"/>
<p>
 Some such review of the language of Sophocles as that which has been imperfectly attempted in this Essay, appears to be necessary in order to interpret him with an approach to certainty. It may also furnish some criterion of the value of emendations of the text. The minute study of the MSS., the Scholia, and the notices of the grammarians, is of course indispensable to this end. But the most perfect <term>apparatus criticus</term> may be only illusory, and may encourage an opinio copiae, which is inter causas inopiae, if it is made the basis of conjectural alteration, without a right conception of the original woof and texture of the <gloss>old garment,</gloss> which is thus patched.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.1" n="1">

<p>
 Many places would never have been suspected of corruption, if the unfixed, growing, and transitional nature of the language had been fully recognized. Subtle and cautious scholars like Hermann and Elmsley were more conscious of this than most of their successors. But their fine perceptions of certain nuances of style and idiom, for want of some systematic statement of them, have often passed unregarded, and were not sufficiently carried into application even by themselves. Had they more fully expressed themselves on this subject, they would have produced a critical instrument of finer temper and more effective although more delicate use, than without this can be forged from palaeographical materials, and the expedients which these suggest.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.2" n="2">

<p>
 This subject has lately received an illustration from the disputes which have arisen about the text of Shelley. If that poet's subtle use of language has given rise to supposed emendations, sometimes on the part of those who had lived with him and knew his mind, and if rational criticism has been brought to set aside most of those changes within half a century of his death, how hazardous must such attempts be in the case of Sophocles, or, still more, in that of Aeschylus, of whose meaning Aristophanes could doubt (Ran. 920 foll.), although in the latter case the attempt is justified by frequent and manifest corruptions.
</p>

<p>
 How many conjectural alterations of Shakspeare have been exploded through closer study of Elizabethan English! How few, comparatively speaking, have been established! And yet they were mostly the inventions of ingenious Englishmen, sometimes of poets, whose mother tongue was that of Shakspeare, and who had known Shakspeare all their lives. How much <gloss>farther off,</gloss> as Plato would say, the most accomplished foreigner must necessarily appear in such an endeavour, may be roughly measured by comparing two wrong readings, that of 'physician' for 'precisian' in M. W. W. 2, 1, which Dyce adopted, and <gloss>he smote his leaded pole-axe on the ice,</gloss> which a good German critic has suggested as an <term>emendation</term> of Ham. 1, 12. Neither of these conjectures is true; but which of them is more like truth no Englishman can for a moment doubt. And there is a <pb n="107"/>  difference not less wide between such corrections as Boeckh's φονώ- σαισιν for φοινίαισιν in
<bibl>Ant. 118</bibl>, or Arndt's εὐνάτειρα for θυγάτηρ in
<bibl>O. T. 1112</bibl>, and scores of other conjectures that have been made in either play.
</p>

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtyp="section" xml:base="part2.text.3" n="3">

<p>
 There must still always be a degree of uncertainty in defending MS. readings of the tenth century, because our general conception of what is likely (the 'veri simile' of Lachmann) is based on the whole text which is the subject of dispute. But the close and analytical study of that text may, at least, enable us to reject proposed emendations, which, although not without plausibility on palaeographical, metrical, grammatical, and other technical grounds, may safely be pronounced alien to Sophocles, either as not poetical, or not idiomatic, or as interfering with the natural emphasis and rhythm, or as out of harmony with the context. Mistrust is not unreasonable, when such obvious rhetorical effects as the hesitation of Deianira, and the pleading iteration of Philoctetes, are found to be persistently ignored. We are often justified in saying, Sophocles may have written what we find: he cannot have written what is proposed instead. It has not the Sophoclean colouring; it is like a raw touch on a picture ill-restored.
</p>

<p>
 One object of this Essay will have been served, if it should be found to have contributed anything towards supplying the desideratum which is here indicated.

<p>
 In the foregoing pages I have not taken account of differences in point of language between the several Plays. Such differences exist, but are scarcely marked enough to be exhibited in a tabular form.
</p>

<p>
 It may be well, however, to remind the student who desires to pursue this subject, that the order of the Plays, which is followed for convenience in this edition, is not that of their production. The Oedipus Coloneus, if not the last of the seven, is probably much later than either the Antigone or the Oedipus Rex, and has been thought to share with the Philoctetes, and in a measure also with the Trachiniae, some traces of an altered manner, in which the popular influences, which were so powerful with Euripides, were not without their effect.
</p>

<p>
 The language of the Oedipus Rex is the most highly wrought, while that of the Electra is the simplest. The Antigone, rivalling the Oedipus Rex in energy, has far more directness of expression. The Philoctetes is marked by studied ease and vernacular freedom, reminding the English reader of those poems of Shelley-such as Julian and Maddalo-in which, without losing poetical grace and finish, he reflects the tone of actual conversation. The Ajax approaches the most nearly to an Epic manner, and displays a peculiar fulness in the utterance of passionate feeling. The Trachiniae is pervaded by a singular tenderness and delicacy. The difference of style between the dialogue and the lyrical portions is most marked in the Oedipus Coloneus.
