INTRODUCTORY ESSAY ON THE LANGUAGE OF SOPHOCLES.
</head>

<p>
 The language of the Greek writers of the fifth century <quote>в. с. ех</quote>hibits a degree of variety, which contrasts equally with the uniformity of Epic poetry and the comparative sameness of Xenophon and the Athenian orators. In no period of any literature do there exist so many linguistic differences between writers who were almost contemporary. These are not simply matters of dialect, and are not adequately described as peculiarities of style. They appear also in a tentative use of words and grammatical constructions which could only have been allowed even to great original writers in a comparatively early stage of literature. They are characteristic of the time when the most copious and plastic of Western tongues was growing into new forms under a manifold creative impulse, given by minds possessed of extraordinary genius and stimulated to intense activity by changes of national and political life. A wider experience than had found utterance in the recitations of the rhapsodists, or in the simpler tones of the earlier lyric and gnomic poetry, and the growth of reflection, giving at once more concentration to thought and also the power of analysing it, required new vehicles of expression. And the first attempt to frame these in the different kinds of Greek literature led to many novelties of language, some of which did not permanently retain their hold. Each writer had his own tendencies, resulting in anomalies peculiar to him and in an undeveloped but active state both of speech and thought, these licences passed unquestioned and easily found acceptance.

<p>
 The limits of such divergence were not yet determined by grammatical rules. The race that gave grammar to Europe were by this time not unconscious of the complex structure of their language<note n="1">See the Preface to this edition.</note>, but this consciousness was still indefinite, and was rather an incentive than    <pb n="2"></pb>  a hindrance to invention. It is not easy for us, who often speak as well as write 'like a book,' to imagine what the art of composition must be in such a period of transition, when every considerable writer is a creative artist, and moulds the materials of common speech of the rhapsodists, or in the simpler tones of the earlier lyric and gnomic poetry, and the growth of reflection, giving at once more concentration to thought and also the power of analysing it, required new vehicles of expression.
